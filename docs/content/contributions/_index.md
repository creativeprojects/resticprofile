# Contributions

Please share your resticprofile recipes, fancy configuration files, or tips and tricks.

- [ansible playbook](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/tree/master/contrib/ansible)
- [shell completion](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/tree/master/contrib/completion)
- [export status to grafana](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/tree/master/contrib/grafana)
- [send email on systemd timer error](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/tree/master/contrib/systemd)
