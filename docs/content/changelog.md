# v0.29.0 (2024-10-28)

## üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Halloween edition üéÉ

# v0.27.0 (2024-06-27)

## üåª Summer release üåû

Summer is here in the Northern Hemisphere! A new release is here too! üéâ

A lot of goodies in this release:

### new run-schedule command

It's more a _behind the scene_ feature: you no longer need to re-schedule your targets after you changed the configuration. The generated schedule command line is now using this new `run-schedule` command that reads all the newest bits from the configuration.

You might want to `unschedule` and `schedule` all your profiles one last time to replace the existing command line using the new `run-schedule` command.

More information: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/commands/index.html#run-schedule-command

### direct support for crontab files

Previously resticprofile was using the `crontab` tool to read and write `crond` schedules. Now you can directly setup a `crontab` file no matter which tool is going to consume it.

More information: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/schedules/index.html

### keep content of configuration variables between commands

This was a big issue for some time. The wait is over! You can now set a configuration variable anywhere in a script and use its value later.

More information: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/run_hooks/index.html#passing-environment-variables

### "RESTICPROFILE_{FLAGNAME}" env vars

All cli flags can now be set using environment variables.

More information: [#334](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/issues/334)

### allow controlling command output redirection

Allow redirection of the console messages to a log file or to syslog.

More information: [#343](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/pull/343)

### Add "--stderr" to redirect console to stderr (for "cat" and "dump")

More information: https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/pull/353

### Add option to set working directory for restic backup

More information: https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/pull/354

### many bug fixes!

# v0.26.0 (2024-02-20)

## ü¶Ü Second time lucky February release üöÄ 

üÜï A lot of pre-built binaries have been added on this release. This is to align with the list of pre-built binaries provided by `restic`

- fix missing fields in the `show` command
- weekly docker image build (rebuilt under the same version tag, and as `latest`)
- restrict the `copy` command to a list of snapshots in the configuration

# v0.25.0 (2024-02-08)

## üíñ February release üíù

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential breaking change

The prometheus library used to send metrics to the proxy using `protobuf`.
By default it's now using the more widely used `text` format.

If you have any issue sending metrics to your proxy, you can revert to the previous behaviour by adding this option to your profile (it's **not** a global option)

```yaml
my_profile:
  prometheus-push-format: protobuf
```

More information about the different formats: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#exposition-formats


## New in this version
* fix for CVE-2023-48795
* new option `prometheus-push-format` with values `text` or `protobuf` (#281)
* new option to set log output in `global` section (#277)
* more control over the default systemd service files (#267)
* and bug fixes!

**Thanks to all our contributors for the good work!**

# v0.22.0 (2023-05-06)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Breaking change

The default value of the `job` tag on prometheus gateway push has changed from `command` to `profile.command`.
But don't worry: you can easily revert back to the original value by adding this option in your configuration:

```yaml
prometheus-push-job: "${COMMAND}"
```

## Fixes:
* Complicated scheduling on Windows was sometimes setting up a random delay before starting a job

# v0.21.1 (2023-04-05)

## Bug fixes!

This small release fixes two regression bugs introduced in version `0.21.0`
- the `~` was no longer replaced by the user's home directory for some flag (`repository` and others...)
- environment variables were no longer replaced by their value for some flag (`repository` and others...)

Thanks @jkellerer for the quick fixes üòâ üëçüèª 

## New features from `v0.21.0`
This release adds a verification of all the flags permitted by restic. Only the flags compatible with your version of restic will be generated (prior to this version, any flag like `unknown-flag` would end up on the restic command line as `--unknown-flag`.

Also this version generates a JSON schema: this is the configuration schema which can auto-complete options, and verify that your configuration is correct. It works with any compatible editor for the JSON, TOML and YAML configuration file format. Thanks @jkellerer for the awesome work on this üéâ . [More information here](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/jsonschema/index.html).

Other nice feature is the introduction of the `help` command which works for both all the **resticprofile** and **restic** commands and flags. Try it out!

## Changelog

## Docker images

- `docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:0.16.0`


# v0.15.0 (2021-08-29)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

Version 0.15 fixed some issues with escaping parameters to the restic command line. **If you've used any of these characters in file or directory names in your configuration, please make sure your backup is still working as expected:** `space`, `*`, `?`, `\`, `[`, `'`, `"`.

If for some reason the fix broke your configuration, there's a new flag `legacy-arguments` that you can activate in the `global` section to revert back to the broken implementation:

```yaml
global:
    legacy-arguments: true
```

## New features in 0.15:
- add `.Hostname` in configuration template (#55)
- add description field in profile section
- add support for prometheus file export and push gateway
- hide confidential values in output (#58)
- add `.TmpDir` variable to configuration template (#62)

## This version also includes fixes for:
- resolving special paths starting with a `~` (unixes only)
- warn when the restic binary was not found at the specified location (but still found at a different location)
- resolve glob expressions in backup sources (#63)

## Changelog

* [37a69d7](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/37a69d7) Added "{{.TmpDir}}" to TemplateData (#62)

## Docker images

- `docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:0.15.0`


# v0.14.1 (2021-06-23)

## Bug fix release

This release changes the way the restic binary is searched:
- restic binary path in `global` configuration can now contain the `~` character like `~restic/bin/restic`
- if you specified a path in the `global` configuration and it cannot find the file, a warning will be displayed and resticprofile will keep trying to find a suitable binary

## Changelog

* [4686dd2](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/4686dd2) use shell to resolve special paths with ~
* [823304a](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/commit/823304a) warning when the restic-binary was not found

## Docker images

- `docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:latest`
- `docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:0.11.0`


# v0.10.1 (2020-11-17)

This update changes the way systemd units are generated:
These used to be of type `oneshot` but it means they can be started more than once.
They have been changed to `notify` which is like `simple` but resticprofile is notifying systemd that the schedule has started and stopped.

To change the type on your existing schedules, you'll need to run the commands `unschedule` and `schedule` again.

## Changelog

# v0.7.1 (2020-06-25)

This a maintenance release:
- add a new parameter `run-after-fail` which is running the shell commands after any kind of failure (during other commands or during restic execution)
- a minor breaking change if you use the repository auto-initialization, it will now run **after** the `run-before` scripts. It makes more sense this way (in case you mount your backup disks in `run-before` for example)

# v0.6.0 (2020-04-07)

Complete rewrite of resticprofile in go:

* I tried python and I wasn't particularly impressed
* I tried go and I loved it (also that's what all the cool kids do nowadays)

The default configuration `profiles.conf` is still expected to be in TOML format. But now, resticprofile also supports YAML and JSON file format. Simply feed a `.toml`, `.json` or a `.yaml` file to select the desired format.

The configuration file from the previous versions remains unchanged. There are two additions to it:

* `priority` flags: acts like `nice` on unixes and now available on **all** platforms
* `lock` flag to avoid running two profiles at the same time (this is a *local* lock)


# v0.5.2 (2019-09-26)

Accept a repository from the environment instead of the configuration file

# v0.5.1 (2019-08-12)

- Add a timestamp before each message
- Use colours more readable on light console
- Add a flag to disable all ansi characters (to redirect the output to a file)


# v0.5.0 (2019-06-26)

Adds support for stdin file stream

# v0.4.1 Beta (2019-06-26)

- Adding 'mount' command support
- Allow chained inheritance of environment variables
- Allow inheritance on 'retention' section


# v0.4.0 Beta (2019-06-25)

- Removing ugly KeyboardInterrupt message when you hit CTRL-C
- Allow the host flag to be a boolean (if set to yes the current hostname will be used)
- Also search for restic binary under Windows (like the chocolatey bin folder)
- Adding two options to check repository before and/or after a backup: 'check-before' and 'check-after'
- Run shell commands before and after a backup: 'run-before' and 'run-after'


# v0.3.0 Beta (2019-06-24)

- Added "groups": ability to define groups of profiles to run at once


# v0.2.0 Beta (2019-06-24)

- Fixed compatibility with Windows
- Fixed defect in profile inheritance


# v0.1.0 Beta (2019-06-24)

First 'usable' version of resticprofile!

**Please note the groups are not working yet**
(groups can run multiple configuration in one command)
