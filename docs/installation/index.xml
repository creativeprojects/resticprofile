      <description>Once installed, you can easily upgrade resticprofile to the latest release using this command:
$ resticprofile self-update Please note on versions before 0.10.0, there was an issue with self-updating from linux with ARM processors (like a raspberry pi). This was fixed in version 0.10.0
resticprofile will check for a new version from GitHub releases and asks you if you want to update to the new version. If you add the flag -q or --quiet to the command line, it will update automatically without asking.</description>

      <description>Using resticprofile from a docker image You can run resticprofile inside a docker container. It is probably the easiest way to install resticprofile (and restic at the same time) and keep it updated.
But be aware that you will need to mount your backup source (and destination if it&amp;rsquo;s local) as a docker volume. Depending on your operating system, the backup might be slower. Volumes mounted on a mac OS host are well known for being quite slow.</description>
