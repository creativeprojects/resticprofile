You can configure a copy section like this:\n[default] initialize = false repository = \"/backup/original\" password-file = \"key\"   [default.copy]  initialize = true  repository = \"/backup/copy\"  password-file = \"other_key\" You will note that the secondary repository doesn’t need to have a 2 behind its flags (repository2, password-file2, etc.). It’s because the flags are well separated in the configuration.\nHere’s the same configuration in YAML format:\ndefault:  initialize: false  repository: \"/backup/original\"  password-file: key  copy:  initialize: true  repository: \"/backup/copy\"  password-file: other_key ",
