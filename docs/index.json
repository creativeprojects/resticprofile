It’s because the flags are well separated in the configuration.\n",

If the lock is not considered stale, retry the restic command every restic-lock-retry-after (default 1 minute) until it acquired the lock, or fail as the lock-wait duration has passed.  Note: The lock wait duration is cumulative. If various locks in one profile-run require lock wait, the total wait time may not exceed the duration that was specified.\nrestic lock management resticprofile can retry restic commands that fail on acquiring a lock and can also ask restic to unlock stale locks.

This is fine if you’re only saving your documents (or any other file inside your profile). Please note on systemd that the schedule will only run when your user is logged in.\n  system: if you need to access some system or protected files. You will need to run resticprofile with sudo on unixes and with elevated prompt on Windows (please note on Windows resticprofile will ask you for elevated permissions automatically if needed).\n  empty: resticprofile will try its best guess based on how you started it (with sudo or as a normal user) and fallback to user\n  schedule-lock-mode Starting from version 0.14.0, schedule-lock-mode accepts 3 values:\n default: Wait on acquiring a lock for the time duration set in schedule-lock-wait, before failing a schedule. Behaves like fail when schedule-lock-wait is “0” or not specified. fail: Any lock failure causes a schedule to abort immediately. ignore: Skip resticprofile locks. restic locks are not skipped and can abort the schedule.  schedule-lock-wait Sets the amount of time to wait for a resticprofile and restic lock to become available. Is only used when schedule-lock-mode is unset or default.\nschedule-log Allow to redirect all output from resticprofile and restic to a file\nschedule-priority (systemd and launchd only) Starting from version 0.11.0, schedule-priority accepts two values:\n background: the process shouldn’t be noticeable when working on the machine at the same time (this is the default) standard: the process should get the same priority as any other process on the machine (but it won’t run faster if you’re not using the machine at the same time)  schedule-priority is not available for windows task scheduler, nor crond\nschedule The schedule parameter accepts many forms of input from the systemd calendar event type. This is by far the easiest to use: It is the same format used to schedule on macOS and Windows.\nThe most general form is:\nweekdays year-month-day hour:minute:second  use * to mean any use , to separate multiple entries use .. for a range  limitations:\n the divider (/), the ~ and timezones are not (yet?) supported on macOS and Windows. the year and second fields have no effect on macOS.

Otherwise it will only be enabled on the next reboot. If you dont’ want to start (and enable) it now, pass the --no-start flag to the command line.\nAlso if you use the --all flag to schedule all your profiles at once, make sure you use only the user mode or system mode.

    "content": "Variable expansion in configuration file You might want to reuse the same configuration (or bits of it) on different environments. One way of doing it is to create a generic configuration where specific bits will be replaced by a variable.\nPre-defined variables The syntax for using a pre-defined variable is:\n{{ .VariableName }} The list of pre-defined variables is:\n .Profile.Name (string) .Now (time.Time object) .CurrentDir (string) .ConfigDir (string) .Hostname (string) .Env.{NAME} (string)  Environment variables are accessible using .Env. followed by the name of the environment variable.\nExample: {{ .Env.HOME }} will be replaced by your home directory (on unixes). The equivalent on Windows would be {{ .Env.USERPROFILE }}.\nFor variables that are objects, you can call all public field or method on it. For example, for the variable .Now you can use:\n .Now.Day .Now.Format layout .Now.Hour .Now.Minute .Now.Month .Now.Second .Now.UTC .Now.Unix .Now.Weekday .Now.Year .Now.YearDay  Hand-made variables But you can also define variables yourself. Hand-made variables starts with a $ (PHP anyone?) and get declared and assigned with the := operator (Pascal anyone?). Here’s an example:\n# declare and assign a value to the variable {{ $name := \"something\" }}  # put the content of the variable here tag: \"{{ $name }}\" Examples You can use a combination of inheritance and variables in the resticprofile configuration file like so:\n--- generic:  password-file: \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key\"  repository: \"/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}\"  lock: \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock\"  initialize: true   backup:  check-before: true  exclude:  - /**/.git  exclude-caches: true  one-file-system: false  run-after: echo All Done!  run-before:  - \"echo Hello {{ .Env.LOGNAME }}\"  - \"echo current dir: {{ .CurrentDir }}\"  - \"echo config dir: {{ .ConfigDir }}\"  - \"echo profile started at {{ .Now.Format \"02 Jan 06 15:04 MST\" }}\"  tag:  - \"{{ .Profile.Name }}\"  - dev   retention:  after-backup: true  before-backup: false  compact: false  keep-within: 30d  prune: true  tag:  - \"{{ .Profile.Name }}\"  - dev   snapshots:  tag:  - \"{{ .Profile.Name }}\"  - dev  src:  inherit: generic  backup:  source:  - \"{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src\" This is obviously not a real world example, but it shows many of the possibilities you can do with variable expansion.\nTo check the generated configuration, you can use the resticprofile show command:\n% resticprofile -c examples/template.yaml -n src show global: default-command: snapshots restic-binary: restic min-memory: 100 src: backup: check-before: true run-before: echo Hello CP echo current dir: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile echo config dir: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples echo profile started at 04 Nov 20 21:56 GMT run-after: echo All Done! source: /Users/CP/go/src tag: src dev exclude: /**/.git exclude-caches: true retention: after-backup: true keep-within: 30d prune: true tag: src dev repository: /backup/Wednesday password-file: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/src-key initialize: true lock: /Users/CP/resticprofile-profile-src.lock snapshots: tag: src dev As you can see, the src profile inherited from the generic profile. The tags {{ .Profile.Name }} got replaced by the name of the current profile src. Now you can reuse the same generic configuration in another profile.\nHere’s another example of an HCL configuration on Linux where I use a variable $mountpoint set to a USB drive mount point:\nglobal {  priority = \"low\"  ionice = true  ionice-class = 2  ionice-level = 6 }  {{ $mountpoint := \"/mnt/external\" }}  default {  repository = \"local:{{ $mountpoint }}/backup\"  password-file = \"key\"  run-before = \"mount {{ $mountpoint }}\"  run-after = \"umount {{ $mountpoint }}\"  run-after-fail = \"umount {{ $mountpoint }}\"   backup {  exclude-caches = true  source = [ \"/etc\", \"/var/lib/libvirt\" ]  check-after = true  } } Configuration templates Templates are a great way to compose configuration profiles.\nPlease keep in mind that yaml files are sensitive to the number of spaces. Also if you declare a block already declared, it overrides the previous declaration (instead of merging them).\nFor that matter, configuration template is probably more useful if you use the toml or hcl configuration format.\nHere’s a simple example\n{{ define \"hello\" }} hello = \"world\" {{ end }} To use the content of this template anywhere in your configuration, simply call it:\n{{ template \"hello\" . }} Note the dot after the name: it’s used to pass the variables to the template. Without it, all your variables (like .Profile.Name) would display \u003cno value\u003e.\nHere’s a working example:\n# # This is an example of TOML configuration using nested templates #  # nested template declarations # this template declaration won't appear here in the configuration file # it will only appear when called by {{ template \"backup_root\" . }} {{ define \"backup_root\" }}  exclude = [ \"{{ .Profile.Name }}-backup.log\" ]  exclude-file = [  \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/root-excludes\",  \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/excludes\"  ]  exclude-caches = true  tag = [ \"root\" ]  source = [ \"/\" ] {{ end }}  [global] priority = \"low\" ionice = true ionice-class = 2 ionice-level = 6  [base] status-file = \"{{ .Env.HOME }}/status.json\"   [base.snapshots]  host = true   [base.retention]  host = true  after-backup = true  keep-within = \"30d\"  #########################################################  [nas] inherit = \"base\" repository = \"rest:http://{{ .Env.BACKUP_REST_USER }}:{{ .Env.BACKUP_REST_PASSWORD }}@nas:8000/root\" password-file = \"nas-key\"  # root  [nas-root] inherit = \"nas\"   [nas-root.backup]  # get the content of \"backup_root\" defined at the top  {{ template \"backup_root\" . }}  schedule = \"01:47\"  schedule-permission = \"system\"  schedule-log = \"{{ .Profile.Name }}-backup.log\"  #########################################################  [azure] inherit = \"base\" repository = \"azure:restic:/\" password-file = \"azure-key\" lock = \"/tmp/resticprofile-azure.lock\"   [azure.backup]  schedule-permission = \"system\"  schedule-log = \"{{ .Profile.Name }}-backup.log\"  # root  [azure-root] inherit = \"azure\"   [azure-root.backup]  # get the content of \"backup_root\" defined at the top  {{ template \"backup_root\" . }}  schedule = \"03:58\"  # mysql  [azure-mysql] inherit = \"azure\"   [azure-mysql.backup]  tag = [ \"mysql\" ]  run-before = [  \"rm -f /tmp/mysqldumpall.sql\",  \"mysqldump -u{{ .Env.MYSQL_BACKUP_USER }} -p{{ .Env.MYSQL_BACKUP_PASSWORD }} --all-databases \u003e /tmp/mysqldumpall.sql\"  ]  source = \"/tmp/mysqldumpall.sql\"  run-after = [  \"rm -f /tmp/mysqldumpall.sql\"  ]  schedule = \"03:18\" Debugging your template and variable expansion If for some reason you don’t understand why resticprofile is not loading your configuration file, you can display the generated configuration after executing the template (and replacing the variables and everything) using the --trace flag.\nLimitations of using templates There’s something to be aware of when dealing with templates: at the time the template is compiled, it has no knowledge of what the end configuration should look like: it has no knowledge of profiles for example. Here is a non-working example of what I mean:\n{{ define \"retention\" }}  [{{ .Profile.Name }}.retention]  after-backup = true  before-backup = false  compact = false  keep-within = \"30d\"  prune = true {{ end }}  [src] password-file = \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key\" repository = \"/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}\" lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock\" initialize = true   [src.backup]  source = \"{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src\"  check-before = true  exclude = [\"/**/.git\"]  exclude-caches = true  tag = [\"{{ .Profile.Name }}\", \"dev\"]   {{ template \"retention\" . }}   [src.snapshots]  tag = [\"{{ .Profile.Name }}\", \"dev\"]  [other] password-file = \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key\" repository = \"/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}\" lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock\" initialize = true   {{ template \"retention\" . }} Here we define a template retention that we use twice. When you ask for a configuration of a profile, either src or other the template will change all occurrences of { .Profile.Name } to the name of the profile, no matter where it is inside the file.\n% resticprofile -c examples/parse-error.toml -n src show 2020/11/06 21:39:48 cannot load configuration file: cannot parse toml configuration: While parsing config: (35, 6): duplicated tables exit status 1 Run the command again, this time asking a display of the compiled version of the configuration:\n% go run . -c examples/parse-error.toml -n src --trace show 2020/11/06 21:48:20 resticprofile 0.10.0-dev compiled with go1.15.3 2020/11/06 21:48:20 Resulting configuration for profile 'default': ==================== 1: 2: 3: [src] 4: password-file = \"/Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/default-key\" 5: repository = \"/backup/Friday\" 6: lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-default.lock\" 7: initialize = true 8: 9: [src.backup] 10: source = \"/Users/CP/go/src\" 11: check-before = true 12: exclude = [\"/**/.git\"] 13: exclude-caches = true 14: tag = [\"default\", \"dev\"] 15: 16: 17: [default.retention] 18: after-backup = true 19: before-backup = false 20: compact = false 21: keep-within = \"30d\" 22: prune = true 23: 24: 25: [src.snapshots] 26: tag = [\"default\", \"dev\"] 27: 28: [other] 29: password-file = \"/Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/default-key\" 30: repository = \"/backup/Friday\" 31: lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-default.lock\" 32: initialize = true 33: 34: 35: [default.retention] 36: after-backup = true 37: before-backup = false 38: compact = false 39: keep-within = \"30d\" 40: prune = true 41: 42: ==================== 2020/11/06 21:48:20 cannot load configuration file: cannot parse toml configuration: While parsing config: (35, 6): duplicated tables exit status 1 As you can see in lines 17 and 35, there are 2 sections of the same name. They could be both called [src.retention], but actually the reason why they’re both called [default.retention] is that resticprofile is doing a first pass to load the [global] section using a profile name of default.\nThe fix for this configuration is very simple though, just remove the section name from the template:\n{{ define \"retention\" }}  after-backup = true  before-backup = false  compact = false  keep-within = \"30d\"  prune = true {{ end }}  [src] password-file = \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key\" repository = \"/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}\" lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock\" initialize = true   [src.backup]  source = \"{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src\"  check-before = true  exclude = [\"/**/.git\"]  exclude-caches = true  tag = [\"{{ .Profile.Name }}\", \"dev\"]   [src.retention]  {{ template \"retention\" . }}   [src.snapshots]  tag = [\"{{ .Profile.Name }}\", \"dev\"]  [other] password-file = \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key\" repository = \"/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}\" lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock\" initialize = true   [other.retention]  {{ template \"retention\" . }} And now you no longer end up with duplicated sections.\nDocumentation on template, variable expansion and other configuration scripting There are a lot more you can do with configuration templates. If you’re brave enough, you can read the full documentation of the Go templates.\nFor a more end-user kind of documentation, you can also read hugo documentation on templates which is using the same Go implementation, but don’t talk much about the developer side of it. Please note there are some functions only made available by hugo though.\n",

When you ask for a configuration of a profile, either src or other the template will change all occurrences of { .Profile.Name } to the name of the profile, no matter where it is inside the file.\n% resticprofile -c examples/parse-error.toml -n src show 2020/11/06 21:39:48 cannot load configuration file: cannot parse toml configuration: While parsing config: (35, 6): duplicated tables exit status 1 Run the command again, this time asking a display of the compiled version of the configuration:\n% go run . -c examples/parse-error.toml -n src --trace show 2020/11/06 21:48:20 resticprofile 0.10.0-dev compiled with go1.15.3 2020/11/06 21:48:20 Resulting configuration for profile 'default': ==================== 1: 2: 3: [src] 4: password-file = \"/Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/default-key\" 5: repository = \"/backup/Friday\" 6: lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-default.lock\" 7: initialize = true 8: 9: [src.backup] 10: source = \"/Users/CP/go/src\" 11: check-before = true 12: exclude = [\"/**/.git\"] 13: exclude-caches = true 14: tag = [\"default\", \"dev\"] 15: 16: 17: [default.retention] 18: after-backup = true 19: before-backup = false 20: compact = false 21: keep-within = \"30d\" 22: prune = true 23: 24: 25: [src.snapshots] 26: tag = [\"default\", \"dev\"] 27: 28: [other] 29: password-file = \"/Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/default-key\" 30: repository = \"/backup/Friday\" 31: lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-default.lock\" 32: initialize = true 33: 34: 35: [default.retention] 36: after-backup = true 37: before-backup = false 38: compact = false 39: keep-within = \"30d\" 40: prune = true 41: 42: ==================== 2020/11/06 21:48:20 cannot load configuration file: cannot parse toml configuration: While parsing config: (35, 6): duplicated tables exit status 1 As you can see in lines 17 and 35, there are 2 sections of the same name. They could be both called [src.retention], but actually the reason why they’re both called [default.retention] is that resticprofile is doing a first pass to load the [global] section using a profile name of default.\nThe fix for this configuration is very simple though, just remove the section name from the template:\n{{ define \"retention\" }}  after-backup = true  before-backup = false  compact = false  keep-within = \"30d\"  prune = true {{ end }}  [src] password-file = \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key\" repository = \"/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}\" lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock\" initialize = true   [src.backup]  source = \"{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src\"  check-before = true  exclude = [\"/**/.git\"]  exclude-caches = true  tag = [\"{{ .Profile.Name }}\", \"dev\"]   [src.retention]  {{ template \"retention\" . }}   [src.snapshots]  tag = [\"{{ .Profile.Name }}\", \"dev\"]  [other] password-file = \"{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key\" repository = \"/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}\" lock = \"$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock\" initialize = true   [other.retention]  {{ template \"retention\" . }} And now you no longer end up with duplicated sections.\nDocumentation on template, variable expansion and other configuration scripting There are a lot more you can do with configuration templates. If you’re brave enough, you can read the full documentation of the Go templates.\nFor a more end-user kind of documentation, you can also read hugo documentation on templates which is using the same Go implementation, but don’t talk much about the developer side of it. Please note there are some functions only made available by hugo though.\n",

    "content": "Status file for easy monitoring If you need to escalate the result of your backup to a monitoring system, you can definitely use the run-after and run-after-fail scripting.\nBut sometimes we just need something simple that a monitoring system can regularly check. For that matter, resticprofile can generate a simple JSON file with the details of the latest backup/forget/check command. For example I have a Zabbix agent checking this file once a day, and so you can hook up any monitoring system that can interpret a JSON file.\nIn your profile, you simply need to add a new parameter, which is the location of your status file\n[profile] status-file = \"backup-status.json\" Here’s an example of a generated file, where you can see that the last check failed, whereas the last backup succeeded:\n{  \"profiles\": {  \"self\": {  \"backup\": {  \"success\": true,  \"time\": \"2021-03-24T16:36:56.831077Z\",  \"error\": \"\",  \"stderr\": \"\",  \"duration\": 16,  \"files_new\": 215,  \"files_changed\": 0,  \"files_unmodified\": 0,  \"dirs_new\": 58,  \"dirs_changed\": 0,  \"dirs_unmodified\": 0,  \"files_total\": 215,  \"bytes_added\": 296536447,  \"bytes_total\": 362952485  },  \"check\": {  \"success\": false,  \"time\": \"2021-03-24T15:23:40.270689Z\",  \"error\": \"exit status 1\",  \"stderr\": \"unable to create lock in backend: repository is already locked exclusively by PID 18534 on dingo by cloud_user (UID 501, GID 20)\\nlock was created at 2021-03-24 15:23:29 (10.42277s ago)\\nstorage ID 1bf636d2\\nthe `unlock` command can be used to remove stale locks\\n\",  \"duration\": 1  }  }  } } Extended status Note: In the backup section above you can see some fields like files_new, files_total, etc. This information is only available when resticprofile’s output is either not sent to the terminal (e.g. redirected) or when you add the flag extended-status to your backup configuration. This is a technical limitation to ensure restic displays terminal output correctly.\nextended-status or stdout redirection is not needed for these fields:\n success time error stderr duration  extended-status is not set by default because it hides any output from restic\nprofile:  inherit: default  status-file: /home/backup/status.json  backup:  extended-status: true  source: /go  exclude:  - \"/**/.git/\" ",

    "content": "Using resticprofile from a docker image You can run resticprofile inside a docker container. It is probably the easiest way to install resticprofile (and restic at the same time) and keep it updated.\nBut be aware that you will need to mount your backup source (and destination if it’s local) as a docker volume. Depending on your operating system, the backup might be slower. Volumes mounted on a mac OS host are well known for being quite slow.\nBy default, the resticprofile container starts at /resticprofile. So you can feed a configuration this way:\n$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/examples:/resticprofile creativeprojects/resticprofile You can list your profiles:\n$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/examples:/resticprofile creativeprojects/resticprofile profiles Container host name Each time a container is started, it gets assigned a new random name.\nYou can force a hostname\n in your container:  $ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/resticprofile -h my-machine creativeprojects/resticprofile -n profile backup  in your configuration:  [profile] host = \"my-machine\" ",
