launchd on macOS Task Scheduler on Windows systemd on Linux and other BSDs crond as a fallback (requires crontab binary) crontab files (with or without a user column) On Unix systems (excluding macOS), resticprofile uses systemd if available, otherwise it falls back to crond.
See reference / global section for scheduler configuration options.
Each profile can be scheduled independently. Within each profile, these sections can be scheduled:</description></item><item><title>Monitoring</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/monitoring/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/monitoring/index.html</guid><description>Status file Prometheus</description></item><item><title>Resticprofile configuration reference</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/reference/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Sep 2025 16:57:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/reference/index.html</guid><description>Note The configuration file reference is generated from resticprofile‚Äôs data model and restic‚Äôs manual pages.

New Features Enhanced Copy Command Support Copy from repository: Added support for specifying source repositories in copy operations with new from-repository, from-password-file, from-password-command, and other from-* configuration options. This enables more flexible backup copying workflows between different repositories. Improved Windows Task Scheduler Integration Run Level Control: New schedule-run-level option allows setting task privilege levels (lowest, highest, auto) for Windows Task Scheduler. Hide Window Option: New schedule-hide-window option to prevent task windows from interrupting user activity when running with user_logged_on permission. Enhanced Task Management: Completely rewritten task information parsing to fix issues with spaces in filenames. Template Function Enhancements Random Number Generation: New randInt template function for generating pseudo-random numbers with seeded repeatability. Usage: {{ "seed" | randInt low high }} - useful for creating variable schedules or unique identifiers. HTTP Hooks Improvements URL Encoding: Automatic URL encoding applied to ERROR, ERROR_COMMANDLINE, and ERROR_STDERR environment variables when used in URLs. Environment Variable Resolution: Enhanced environment variable resolution in both URL and body of HTTP hooks, with proper separation of URL and body processing. Bug Fixes and Improvements Signal Handling Group Execution: Fixed interrupt signal handling to properly stop execution of remaining profiles in a group when Ctrl+C is pressed. Path Resolution Executable Handling: Enhanced executable path resolution on Linux to properly handle relative paths, PATH lookups, and working directory resolution. Configuration Escaping: Fixed proper escaping of backup source paths in configuration to handle special characters and spaces. Scheduling Fixes Crontab Generation: Fixed crontab file generation to work without user field, improving compatibility with various cron implementations. New contributors Thanks to @lil5, @jeinwag, @hansmi and @zumm for their valuable help in making this new release üéâ</description></item></channel></rss>
