In a nutshell, resticprofile provides a configuration file and a runner that will generate all the necessary calls to restic.
Unless you’re using the resticprofile Docker image, you need to have restic installed on your machine.
Choose your favourite format resticprofile configuration file can be written in:
TOML : configuration file with extension .toml or .conf YAML : configuration file with extension .yaml JSON : configuration file with extension .json HCL: configuration file with extension .hcl We recommend using either TOML or YAML.
JSON is fine for auto generated configurations but is not the easiest format for a human to read and write.
HCL can be interesting if you already use a tool from the Hashicorp stack otherwise that’s yet another format to learn.
Configure your text editor We’re going to show you how to get documentation and auto-completion for the resticprofile configuration using Visual Studio Code.
You can use any other editor that recognise the JSON schema. The same JSON schema can be used for JSON, TOML and YAML file formats.
TOML In Visual Studio Code, you need to install an extension that supports completion and syntax validation using a JSON schema.
For example you can install the Even Better TOML extension:
YAML Same for YAML: in Visual Studio Code you need to install an extension like the one provided by Red Hat to understand the shape of your configuration file.
Write your first configuration file The configuration file is essentially a list of profiles containing a list of commands and flags.
A profile defines:
a restic repository (flag repository) how to access your restic repository (like password-file) a list of commands (like backup): which files to include in a backup (flag source) when to backup them (we’ll see that later) any other restic flags you would add to the command line (like verbose) In this example, we’re going to call our profile default. You don’t need to specify the profile name on the command line when using this name (default).
Create a file named profiles with the extension of your choice (.toml, .yaml, .hcl or .json)
​ toml yaml hcl json #:schema https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json # # indentation is not needed but it makes it easier to read ;) # version = "1" [default] repository = "local:/backup" password-file = "password.txt" [default.backup] verbose = true source = [ "/home" ] # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json version: "1" default: repository: "local:/backup" password-file: "password.txt" backup: verbose: true source: - "/home" default { repository = "local:/backup" password-file = "password.txt" backup = { verbose = true source = [ "/home" ] } } { "$schema": "https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json", "version": "1", "default": { "repository": "local:/backup", "password-file": "password.txt", "backup": { "verbose": true, "source": [ "/home" ] } } } Generate a secure password resticprofile has a handy command that can generate a cryptographically secure password file for you:
resticprofile generate --random-key > password.txtInitialize your repository Now that you have a password file, you can initialize your restic repository:
resticprofile initHere’s an example of the result:
2023/03/25 15:46:48 using configuration file: profiles.yaml 2023/03/25 15:46:48 profile 'default': starting 'init' created restic repository e21ab75046 at local:/backup Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access the repository. Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost. 2023/03/25 15:46:51 profile 'default': finished 'init'Test your first backup Before going live, you can dry run your first backup by using the resticprofile --dry-run flag.
resticprofile --dry-run backupAnd here’s the result:
2023/03/25 15:49:51 using configuration file: profiles.yaml 2023/03/25 15:49:51 profile 'default': starting 'backup' 2023/03/25 15:49:51 dry-run: /usr/local/bin/restic backup --password-file password.txt --repo local:/backup --verbose /home 2023/03/25 15:49:51 profile 'default': finished 'backup'As you can see, resticprofile converted your backup profile into this command line:
/usr/local/bin/restic backup --password-file password.txt --repo local:/backup --verbose /homeFlags Let’s stop a moment and analyse the command line: we passed the flag --dry-run before the command backup: it means the flag is used by resticprofile.
Let’s try again with the flag after the command:
resticprofile backup --dry-runAnd the result is rather different:
2023/03/25 15:50:02 using configuration file: profiles.yaml 2023/03/25 15:50:02 profile 'default': starting 'backup' open repository repository e22aa770 opened (version 2, compression level auto) created new cache in /Users/CP/Library/Caches/restic lock repository no parent snapshot found, will read all files load index files start scan on [/home] start backup on [/home] scan finished in 0.202s: 0 files, 0 B Files: 0 new, 0 changed, 0 unmodified Dirs: 0 new, 0 changed, 0 unmodified Data Blobs: 0 new Tree Blobs: 1 new Would add to the repository: 346 B (292 B stored) processed 0 files, 0 B in 0:00 2023/03/25 15:50:03 profile 'default': finished 'backup'If you add flags after the command, the flags will be sent to restic instead. As you can see, restic simulated a backup of your /home folder.
Schedule Let’s imagine you want to backup your files every day during your lunch break.
Add a line in your configuration (in the default -> backup section) with an option called schedule and a value of 12:30. Your configuration should now look like:
​ toml yaml hcl json #:schema https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json # # indentation is not needed but it makes it easier to read ;) # version = "1" [default] repository = "local:/backup" password-file = "password.txt" [default.backup] verbose = true source = [ "/home" ] schedule = "12:30" # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json version: "1" default: repository: "local:/backup" password-file: "password.txt" backup: verbose: true source: - "/home" schedule: "12:30" default { repository = "local:/backup" password-file = "password.txt" backup = { verbose = true source = [ "/home" ] schedule = "12:30" } } { "$schema": "https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json", "version": "1", "default": { "repository": "local:/backup", "password-file": "password.txt", "backup": { "verbose": true, "source": [ "/home" ], "schedule": "12:30" } } } resticprofile can schedule work on macOS, Windows, most Unixes and Linux distributions: it is simply adding an entry in the default scheduler of your platform.
To schedule the backup of the default profile, simply type the command:
resticprofile scheduleNow your backup will run every day at 12:30. As simple as that!
Inline help You can get help for any command at any time.
The help is available for both the resticprofile internal commands and all the restic commands.
resticprofile help To get the help on a resticprofile command, simply use the help command or command -h:
Example:
$ resticprofile help generate The "generate" command is used to create various resources and print them to stdout Usage: resticprofile [resticprofile flags] generate [command specific flags] Flags: --bash-completion generate a shell completion script for bash --config-reference [--version 0.15] [template] generate a config file reference from a go template (defaults to the built-in markdown template when omitted) --json-schema [--version 0.15] [v1|v2] generate a JSON schema that validates resticprofile configuration files in YAML or JSON format --random-key [size] generate a cryptographically secure random key to use as a restic keyfile (size defaults to 1024 when omitted) --zsh-completion generate a shell completion script for zshrestic help This is the same syntax to display the help from a restic command:
$ resticprofile init -h The "init" command initializes a new repository. EXIT STATUS =========== Exit status is 0 if the command was successful, and non-zero if there was any error. Usage: resticprofile [resticprofile flags] [profile name.]init [flags] Flags: [...]Next Let’s have a look at some examples
`,description:"",tags:null,title:"Getting Started",uri:"/configuration/getting_started/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"",content:` A configuration is a set of profiles. Each profile is in a new section that has the name of the profile. Inside each profile, you can specify different flags for each command. A command definition is in a subsection of the name of the command. ​ toml yaml hcl json [profile_name] [profile_name.backup] profile_name: backup: profile_name { backup = { } } { "profile_name": { "backup": { } } } All the restic flags can be defined in a section. For most of them you just need to remove the two dashes in front.
To set the flag --password-file, the name of the parameter is simply password-file.
There’s one exception: the flag --repo is named repository in the configuration
Example So let’s say you normally use this simple command:
restic --repo "local:/backup" --password-file "password.txt" --verbose backup /homeFor resticprofile to generate this command automatically for you, here’s the configuration file:
​ toml yaml hcl json # indentation is not needed but it makes it easier to read ;) # version = "1" [default] repository = "local:/backup" password-file = "password.txt" [default.backup] verbose = true source = [ "/home" ] version: "1" default: repository: "local:/backup" password-file: "password.txt" backup: verbose: true source: - "/home" default { repository = "local:/backup" password-file = "password.txt" backup = { verbose = true source = [ "/home" ] } } { "version": "1", "default": { "repository": "local:/backup", "password-file": "password.txt", "backup": { "verbose": true, "source": [ "/home" ] } } } You may have noticed the source flag is accepting an array of values (inside brackets in TOML, list of values in YAML)
Now, assuming this configuration file is named profiles.conf in the current folder (it’s the default config file name), you can simply run
resticprofile backupand resticprofile will do its magic and generate the command line for you.
If you have any doubt on what it’s running, you can try a --dry-run:
resticprofile --dry-run backup 2022/05/18 17:14:07 profile 'default': starting 'backup' 2022/05/18 17:14:07 dry-run: /usr/bin/restic backup --password-file password.txt --repo local:/backup --verbose /home 2022/05/18 17:14:07 profile 'default': finished 'backup'More information Getting Started Examples Path Includes Inheritance Copy command Command Hooks HTTP Hooks Templates Variables Warnings Priority Preventing system sleep Logs Reference JSON schema Configuration v2 proposal `,description:"",tags:null,title:"Configuration file",uri:"/configuration/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"",content:`Here are a few examples how to run resticprofile (using the main example configuration file)

resticprofile --helpA command is either a restic command or a resticprofile own command.
Command line reference There are not many options on the command line, most of the options are in the configuration file.
[-h | –help]: Display quick help [-c | –config] configuration_file: Specify a configuration file other than the default (“profiles”) [-f | –format] configuration_format: Specify the configuration file format: toml, yaml, json or hcl [-n | –name] profile_name: Profile section to use from the configuration file. You can also use [profile_name].[command] syntax instead, this will only work if -n is not set. Using -n [profile_name] [command] or [profile_name].[command] both select profile and command and are technically equivalent. [–dry-run]: Doesn’t run the restic commands but display the command lines instead [-q | –quiet]: Force resticprofile and restic to be quiet (override any configuration from the profile) [-v | –verbose]: Force resticprofile and restic to be verbose (override any configuration from the profile) [–trace]: Display even more debugging information [–no-ansi]: Disable console colouring (to save output into a log file) [–no-lock]: Disable resticprofile locks, neither create nor fail on a lock. restic locks are unaffected by this option. [–theme]: Can be light, dark or none. The colours will adjust to a light or dark terminal (none to disable colouring) [–lock-wait] duration: Retry to acquire resticprofile and restic locks for up to the specified amount of time before failing on a lock failure. [-l | –log] file path or url: To write the logs to a file or a syslog server instead of displaying on the console. The format of the server url is tcp://192.168.0.1:514 or udp://localhost:514. For custom log forwarding, the prefix temp: can be used (e.g. temp:/t/msg.log) to create unique log output that can be fed into a command or http hook by referencing it with {{ tempDir }}/... or {{ tempFile "msg.log" }} in the configuration file. [-w | –wait]: Wait at the very end of the execution for the user to press enter. This is only useful in Windows when resticprofile is started from explorer and the console window closes automatically at the end. [resticprofile OR restic command]: Like snapshots, backup, check, prune, forget, mount, etc. [additional flags]: Any additional flags to pass to the restic command line `,description:"",tags:["v0.17.0"],title:"Using resticprofile",uri:"/usage/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"",content:`resticprofile is capable of managing scheduled backups for you. Under the hood it’s using:
launchd on macOS X Task Scheduler on Windows systemd where available (Linux and other BSDs) crond on supported platforms (Linux and other BSDs) On unixes (except macOS) resticprofile is using systemd by default. crond can be used instead if configured in global scheduler parameter:
​ toml yaml hcl json [global] scheduler = "crond" --- global: scheduler: crond "global" = { "scheduler" = "crond" } { "global": { "scheduler": "crond" } } Each profile can be scheduled independently (groups are not available for scheduling yet - it will be available in version ‘2’ of the configuration file).
These 5 profile sections are accepting a schedule configuration:
backup check forget (version 0.11.0) prune (version 0.11.0) copy (version 0.16.0) which mean you can schedule backup, forget, prune, check and copy independently (I recommend using a local lock in this case).
retention schedule is deprecated Starting from version 0.11.0, directly scheduling the retention section is deprecated: Use the forget section for direct schedule instead.
The retention section is designed to be associated with a backup section, not to be scheduled independently.

All metrics with the same grouping key get replaced when pushed. To prevent metrics from multiple profiles getting overwritten by each other, the default job label is set to <profile_name>.<command> (e.g. root.backup).
If you need more control over the job label, you can use the prometheus-push-job property. This property can contain the $command placeholder, which is replaced with the name of the executed command.
Additionally, the request format can be specified with prometheus-push-format. The default is text, but it can also be set to protobuf (see compatibility with Prometheus).
User defined labels You can add your own prometheus labels. Please note they will be applied to all the metrics. Here’s an example:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [root] prometheus-save-to-file = "root.prom" prometheus-push = "http://localhost:9091/" [[root.prometheus-labels]] host = "{{ .Hostname }}" [root.backup] extended-status = true no-error-on-warning = true source = [ "/" ] version: "1" root: prometheus-save-to-file: "root.prom" prometheus-push: "http://localhost:9091/" prometheus-labels: - host: {{ .Hostname }} backup: extended-status: true no-error-on-warning: true source: - / "root" = { "prometheus-save-to-file" = "root.prom" "prometheus-push" = "http://localhost:9091/" "prometheus-labels" = { "host" = "{{ .Hostname }}" } "backup" = { "extended-status" = true "no-error-on-warning" = true "source" = ["/"] } } { "version": "1", "root": { "prometheus-save-to-file": "root.prom", "prometheus-push": "http://localhost:9091/", "prometheus-labels": [ { "host": "{{ .Hostname }}" } ], "backup": { "extended-status": true, "no-error-on-warning": true, "source": [ "/" ] } } } which will add the host label to all your metrics.

You can simply put this key into a file and use it as a strong key for restic.

On other Unix-like systems, the generator reads from /dev/urandom. On Windows systems, the generator uses the uses the RtlGenRandom API. On JS/Wasm, the generator uses the Web Crypto API.

The big exceptions are source in the backup section, status-file, prometheus-save-to-file and the restic repository (if it is a file). These paths are taken as specified, which means they are resolved from the current working directory where you started resticprofile from.
You can influence this behaviour with profile flag base-dir. It allows to set the working directory that resticprofile will change into so that profiles do no longer depend on the path where you started resticprofile from.
For the following configuration example, when assuming it is stored in /opt/resticprofile/profiles.* and resticprofile is started from /home/user/, the individual paths are resolved to:
repository: local:/home/user/backup password-file: /opt/resticprofile/password.txt backup.source: /home/user/files ​ toml yaml hcl json # indentation is not needed but it makes it easier to read ;) # version = "1" [default] base-dir = "" repository = "local:backup" password-file = "password.txt" [default.backup] source-base = "" source = [ "files" ] version: "1" default: base-dir: "" repository: "local:backup" password-file: "password.txt" backup: source-base: "" source: - "files" default { base-dir = "" repository = "local:backup" password-file = "password.txt" backup = { source-base = "" source = [ "files" ] } } { "version": "1", "default": { "base-dir": "", "repository": "local:backup", "password-file": "password.txt", "backup": { "source-base": "", "source": [ "files" ] } } } Set base-dir to an absolute path to resolve files and local:backup relative to it. Set source-base if you need a separate base path for backup sources.
How the configuration file is resolved The default name for the configuration file is profiles, without an extension. You can change the name and its path with the --config or -c option on the command line. You can set a specific extension -c profiles.conf to load a TOML format file. If you set a filename with no extension instead, resticprofile will load the first file it finds with any of these extensions:
.conf (toml format) .yaml .toml .json .hcl macOS X resticprofile will search for your configuration file in these folders:

system: if you need to access some system or protected files. You will need to run resticprofile with sudo on unixes and with elevated prompt on Windows (please note on Windows resticprofile will ask you for elevated permissions automatically if needed).
user: your backup will be running using your current user permissions on files. This is fine if you’re only saving your documents (or any other file inside your profile). Please note on systemd that the schedule will only run when your user is logged in. This mode will ask you for your user password on Windows.
user_logged_on: For Windows only - This gives the same permissions as user. This mode is not asking for your user password but will only run while the user is logged on.
empty: resticprofile will try its best guess based on how you started it (with sudo or as a normal user). The fallback is system on Windows, and user on the other platforms.
Changing schedule-permission from user to system, or system to user If you need to change the permission of a schedule, please be sure to unschedule the profile before.
This order is important:
unschedule the job first. resticprofile does not keep track of how your profile was installed, so you have to remove the schedule first now you can change your permission (user to system, or system to user) schedule your updated profile schedule-lock-mode Starting from version 0.14.0, schedule-lock-mode accepts 3 values:
default: Wait on acquiring a lock for the time duration set in schedule-lock-wait, before failing a schedule. Behaves like fail when schedule-lock-wait is “0” or not specified. fail: Any lock failure causes a schedule to abort immediately. ignore: Skip resticprofile locks. restic locks are not skipped and can abort the schedule. schedule-lock-wait Sets the amount of time to wait for a resticprofile and restic lock to become available. Is only used when schedule-lock-mode is unset or default.
schedule-log schedule-log can be used in two ways:
Allow to redirect all output from resticprofile and restic to a file. The parameter should point to a file (/path/to/file) Redirects all resticprofile log entries to the syslog server. In that case the parameter is a URL like: udp://server:514 or tcp://127.0.0.1:514 If there’s no server answering on the port specified, resticprofile will send the logs to the default output instead.
schedule-priority (systemd and launchd only) Starting from version 0.11.0, schedule-priority accepts two values:
background: the process shouldn’t be noticeable when working on the machine at the same time (this is the default) standard: the process should get the same priority as any other process on the machine (but it won’t run faster if you’re not using the machine at the same time) schedule-priority is not available for windows task scheduler, nor crond
schedule The schedule parameter accepts many forms of input from the systemd calendar event type. This is by far the easiest to use: It is the same format used to schedule on macOS and Windows.
The most general form is:
weekdays year-month-day hour:minute:second use * to mean any use , to separate multiple entries use .. for a range limitations:
the divider (/), the ~ and timezones are not (yet?) supported on macOS and Windows. the year and second fields have no effect on macOS. They do have limited availability on Windows (they don’t make much sense anyway). Here are a few examples (taken from the systemd documentation):

The HCL format is special in that it cannot be mixed with other formats.
Within included files, the current configuration path is not changed. Path resolution remains relative to the path of the main configuration file.
Note Included files cannot include nested files. Specifying includes inside an included file has no effect.
Configuration Merging Loading a configuration file involves loading the physical file from disk and applying all variables and templates prior to parsing the file in a supported format hcl, json, toml and yaml. This means variables and templates must create valid configuration markup that can be parsed or loading will fail.
Configuration files are loaded and applied in a fixed order:
The main configuration file is loaded first includes are iterated in declaration order: Every item may be a single file path or glob expression Glob expressions are resolved and iterated in alphabetical order All paths are resolved relative to configuration path Configuration files are loaded in the following order when assuming /etc/resticprofile/profiles.conf with includes = ["first.conf", "conf.d/*.conf", "last.conf"]:

Configuration properties are replaced Configuration structure (tree) is merged What includes later overrides what defines earlier Lists of values or lists of objects are considered properties not config structure and will be replaced ​ profiles.yaml first.yaml second.yaml Final configuration version: "1" includes: - first.yaml - second.yaml default: backup: source: - /usr version: "1" default: initialize: false backup: source: - /etc - /opt version: "1" default: initialize: true backup: exclude: - .* version: "1" includes: - first.yaml - second.yaml default: initialize: true backup: exclude: - .* source: - /etc - /opt Tip You can use resticprofile [<profile-name>.]show (or resticprofile [--name <profile-name>] show) to see the resulting configuration after merging.
Note resticprofile prior to v0.18.0 had a slightly different behaviour when merging configuration properties of a different type (e.g. number <-> text or list <-> single value). In such cases the existing value was not overridden by an included file, breaking the rule “what includes later overrides what defines earlier”.

Playbooks resticprofile.yml (6 KB) This is very much work in progress. Once I get a stable ansible script I should publish it to Ansible Galaxy.
The playbook is installing (or upgrading):
latest restic binary to /usr/local/bin latest resticprofile binary to /usr/local/bin the resticprofile configuration file from a template file found in ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/profiles.* to /root/resticprofile/profiles.* password files that can be encrypted using ansible vault. These files are located in ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/keys/*: they will be decrypted and saved to /root/resticprofile/. other files (like files needed for --exclude-file, --files-from or anything else you need) from ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/copy/* to /root/resticprofile/ Note This new version (21st Feb 2023) installs the github3 python packages in a virtual environment. This seems to avoid having to compile the cryptography package, which is a huge time saver.
Previously, the playbook wasn’t running in a virtual environment. For that matter it needed a whole bunch of packages including cryptography, which in turn needed the libssl-dev package (on debian) and a rust compiler.
Requirements Each target machine must have one variable named arch containing the resticprofile OS & Arch. You can see a list of all the available OS & Arch couples on the releases page.
Typically, a binary will be distributed using this convention:
resticprofile-[VERSION]_[OS]_[ARCH].tar.gz
Your host variables file should declare a arch variable containing the [OS]_[ARCH] part of the file name.
Examples: arch: linux_amd64or for a Raspberry pi 3+:
arch: linux_armv7Note: I might find a way to detect this automatically at some point
`,description:"",tags:null,title:"Ansible",uri:"/installation/ansible/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Configuration file",content:` Tip You can use resticprofile [<profile-name>.]show (or resticprofile [--name <profile-name>] show) to see the effect inheritance has on a profile
Profile Inheritance Profiles can inherit from a parent profile. This allows to define the general behaviour and common configuration in a base profile while derived profiles only define what is specific, e.g. what needs to be included in the backup or which command hooks (e.g. run-before, run-after & run-finally) must be started.
When assuming profile “backup-homes” inherits from profile “base”, then the effective configuration of “backup-homes” is built by merging the profile configuration of “backup-homes” into “base”.
Profile configuration merging follows the same logic as configuration merging in includes:
What defines in the parent profile is replaced by definitions from the derived profile Configuration structure is merged, configuration properties are replaced A profile declares that it inherits from a parent by setting the property inherit to the name of the parent profile There is no default inheritance. If inherit is not set, no inheritance applies ​ Profile ‘base’ (yaml) Profile ‘backup-homes’ (yaml) … after applying ‘inherit’ version: "1" base: initialize: true repository: local:/backup/my-repo password-file: my-repo.key retention: after-backup: true keep-last: 2 keep-hourly: 1 keep-daily: 1 keep-weekly: 1 backup: exclude: - "*." - "*~" - "/backup/*" source: - / version: "1" backup-homes: inherit: base retention: keep-hourly: false keep-daily: 30 keep-weekly: 26 backup: source: - /home/ version: "1" backup-homes: initialize: true repository: local:/backup/my-repo password-file: my-repo.key retention: after-backup: true keep-last: 2 keep-hourly: false keep-daily: 30 keep-weekly: 26 backup: exclude: - "*." - "*~" - "/backup/*" source: - /home/ Note Configurations prior to version 2, treat lists as if they were configuration structure. Instead of replacing the parent with the derived list entirely, a derived list is merged into the parent list using list-index as key.
This differs from how includes handle lists and may lead to unexpected results. In configuration file format version 2 the behavior was changed to match that of includes and extended with a deterministic way of pre- & appending to list properties.
Inheritance of List Properties Starting with configuration format version 2, lists are no longer considered configuration structure and are replaced in derived profiles in the same way as inheritance behaves for any non-list properties. For example, when the parent and child profile define the same list property like run-before or source, the declaration of the child property replaces the declaration of the parent property entirely.
For version 2, when the parent defined source = ['/my-files1', '/my-files2'] and the child source = ['/my-other-files'], then only /my-other-files will really make it into the backup.
In contrast to this, configurations in version 1 partially merge lists on the list index. E.g. when the parent profile defines 2 items and the child only one, then the first entry in parent is replaced with the single child item and the second parent item is derived into the child profile.
For version 1, when the parent defined source = ['/my-files1', '/my-files2'] and the child source = ['/my-other-files'], then /my-other-files and /my-files2 will make it into the backup.
Prepend & Append to List Properties Config format version 2 Feature preview, may change without notice
Inheritance in configuration format version 2 can prepend and append to parent list properties. This feature replaces list merging of version 1.
Assuming the parent profile declares the list property <list-property>:
<list-property>... or <list-property>__APPEND appends to the list property ...<list-property> or <list-property>__PREPEND prepends to the list property ​ yaml toml version: 2 profiles: default: backup: exclude: - '.*' - '~*' derived-profile: inherit: default backup: exclude...: '.git' source: '/myrepo' version = 2 [profiles.default.backup] exclude = ['.*', '~*'] [profiles.derived-profile] inherit = 'default' [profiles.derived-profile.backup] exclude__APPEND = '.git' source = '/myrepo' In the examples above, the final value of exclude in derived-profile is ['.*', '~*', '.git'].
Mixins Config format version 2 Feature preview, may change without notice
Mixins offer an easy way to share pieces of configuration between profiles without forcing a hierarchy of inheritance. Mixins can be used at every level within the profile configuration, support parametrisation (vars) and similar to hierarchic inheritance, they can prepend or append to list properties in addition to setting or replacing properties.
Mixins are declared in section mixins as named objects. The contents of these objects are merged into the profile configuration wherever a use property references (uses) the mixin. Configuration merging is following the same logic as used in inheritance and includes. When use references multiple mixins, the mixins apply in the order they are referenced and can override each other (mixins referenced later override what earlier mixins defined).
Configuration values inside a mixin may be parametrized with variables following the syntax \${variable} or $variable. Defaults for variables can be defined inside the mixin with default-vars and use can specify variables before merging the mixin. In difference to configuration variables that expand prior to parsing, mixin variables expand when the mixin is merged and for this reason the syntax differs.
Unlike configuration variables and templates, mixins create parsed configuration structure not config markup that requires parsing. This allows mixins to be defined in one supported config format (yaml, toml, json) while being used in any other supported format when the configuration is split into multiple includes.
​ yaml yaml (with vars) toml toml (with vars) version: 2 mixins: name-of-mixin: config-key: config-value profiles: profile: # set config-key to config-value in "profile" use: name-of-mixin version: 2 mixins: name-of-mixin: default-vars: WHAT: World parametrized-config-key: Hello $WHAT profiles: profile: # set parametrized-config-key to "Hello World" in "profile" use: name-of-mixin profile-non-default: # set parametrized-config-key to "Hello Mixin" in "profile-non-default" use: - name: name-of-mixin WHAT: "Mixin" version = 2 [mixins.name-of-mixin] config-key = "config-value" [profiles.profile] # set config-key to config-value in "profile" use = "name-of-mixin" version = 2 [mixins.name-of-mixin] parametrized-config-key = "Hello $WHAT" [mixins.name-of-mixin.default-vars] WHAT = "World" [profiles.profile] # set parametrized-config-key to "Hello World" in "profile" use = "name-of-mixin" [profiles.profile-non-default] # set parametrized-config-key to "Hello Mixin" in "profile-non-default" use = { name = "name-of-mixin", WHAT = "Mixin" } Named Mixin Declaration Every named mixin object below the mixins section has the following structure (all properties are optional):
Property Purpose default-vars: <variable-name> Default value for variable $<variable-name> <config-key> Set <config-key> when the mixin is used <config-key>: <sub-key> Set <sub-key> below <config-key> <config-key>... or <config-key>__APPEND Change <config-key> to a list and append to it ...<config-key> or <config-key>__PREPEND Change <config-key> to a list and prepend to it Mixin Usage The use property can be placed at any depth inside the profile configuration and is referencing a single mixin, a list of mixin names or a list of names and use-objects.
Every use object within the use list has the following structure:
Property Purpose name Name of the mixin to use and merge in place of the use property vars: <variable-name> Set mixin variable $<variable-name> <variable-name> Set mixin variable $<variable-name> (short syntax) Mixins are applied to the configuration after processing all includes but prior to profile inheritance which means the use properties are not inherited but the result of applying use is inherited instead. What is defined by a mixin in a parent profile can still be overridden by a definition in a derived profile, but derived profiles can not change which mixins apply to their parent.
List properties that have been inherited from a parent can be modified (append/prepend) and replaced by a mixin.

While a profile has several predefined common properties (repository, password-file, …), any arbitrary common flags can be set directly inside the profile and will be inherited by all command sections of the profile.
Resticprofile applies a filter (see global.restic-arguments-filter) to decide which flags are supported in which restic commands and automatically removes unsupported flags when building commandline options.
For example, a flag like insecure-tls can be set at profile level and will be used whenever restic is started with this profile. Most supported flags can be set in this way at profile level, see reference for details.
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [default] repository = "rest:https://backup-host/my-repo" insecure-tls = true [default.backup] source = "/" version: "1" default: repository: rest:https://backup-host/my-repo insecure-tls: true backup: source: / default { repository = "rest:https://backup-host/my-repo" insecure-tls = true backup { source = "/" } } { "version": "1", "default": { "repository": "rest:https://backup-host/my-repo", "insecure-tls": true, "backup": { "source": "/" } } } Resulting in the following restic commandline:
resticprofile --dry-run backup ... dry-run: /usr/local/bin/restic backup --insecure-tls --repo rest:https://backup-host/my-repo / resticprofile --dry-run prune ... dry-run: /usr/local/bin/restic prune --insecure-tls --repo rest:https://backup-host/my-repo Tip The option --dry-run prints restic commands to console or log file. To see what flags are effectively used with each restic command involved in backup, use resticprofile --dry-run [<profile-name>.]backup.

`,description:"",tags:null,title:"Source",uri:"/installation/source/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Configuration file",content:`Special case for the copy command section The copy command needs two repositories (and quite likely 2 different set of keys). You can configure a copy section like this:

It’s because the flags are well separated in the configuration and there’s no ambiguity.
Initialisation If you want to initialize the copy repository using the copy-chunker-params flag, it needs to be called initialize-copy-chunker-params instead. As such, this flag does not exist on the copy target which is why we need to prefix it.

Since resticprofile can run several commands in a profile, it could be better to run the whole batch in a lock so nobody can interfere in the meantime.
For this to happen you can specify a lock file in each profile:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [src] lock = "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock" [src.backup] check-before = true exclude = [ "/**/.git" ] source = [ "~/go" ] [src.retention] after-backup = true before-backup = false compact = false keep-within = "30d" prune = true version: "1" src: lock: "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock" backup: check-before: true exclude: - /**/.git source: - ~/go retention: after-backup: true before-backup: false compact: false keep-within: 30d prune: true "src" = { "lock" = "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock" "backup" = { "check-before" = true "exclude" = ["/**/.git"] "source" = ["~/go"] } "retention" = { "after-backup" = true "before-backup" = false "compact" = false "keep-within" = "30d" "prune" = true } } { "version": "1", "src": { "lock": "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock", "backup": { "check-before": true, "exclude": [ "/**/.git" ], "source": [ "~/go" ] }, "retention": { "after-backup": true, "before-backup": false, "compact": false, "keep-within": "30d", "prune": true } } } For this profile, a lock will be set using the file /tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock for the duration of the profile: check, backup and retention (via the forget command)
Please note restic locks and resticprofile locks are completely independent
Stale locks In some cases, resticprofile as well as restic may leave a lock behind if the process died (or the machine rebooted).
For that matter, if you add the flag force-inactive-lock to your profile, resticprofile will detect and remove stale locks:
resticprofile locks: Check for the presence of a process with the PID indicated in the lockfile. If it can’t find any, it will try to delete the lock and continue the operation (locking again, running profile and so on…) restic locks: Evaluate if a restic command failed on acquiring a lock. If the lock is older than restic-stale-lock-age, invoke restic unlock and retry the command that failed (can be disabled by setting restic-stale-lock-age to 0, default is 1h). ​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [global] restic-stale-lock-age = "2h" [src] lock = "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock" force-inactive-lock = true version: "1" global: restic-stale-lock-age: 2h src: lock: "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock" force-inactive-lock: true "global" = { "restic-stale-lock-age" = "2h" } "src" = { "lock" = "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock" "force-inactive-lock" = true } { "version": "1", "global": { "restic-stale-lock-age": "2h" }, "src": { "lock": "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock", "force-inactive-lock": true } } Lock wait By default, restic and resticprofile fail when a lock cannot be acquired as another process is currently holding it.
Depending on the use case (e.g. scheduled backups), it may be more appropriate to wait on another process to finish instead of failing immediately.
For that matter, if you add the commandline flag --lock-wait or configure schedules with schedule-lock-wait, resticprofile will wait on other backup processes:
resticprofile locks: Retry acquiring the lockfile until it either succeeds (when the other resticprofile process released the lock) or fail as the lock-wait duration has passed without success. restic locks: Evaluate if a restic command failed on acquiring a lock. If the lock is not considered stale, retry the restic command every restic-lock-retry-after (default 1 minute) until it acquired the lock, or fail as the lock-wait duration has passed. Note: The lock wait duration is cumulative. If various locks in one profile-run require lock wait, the total wait time may not exceed the duration that was specified.
restic lock management resticprofile can retry restic commands that fail on acquiring a lock and can also ask restic to unlock stale locks. The behaviour is controlled by 2 settings inside the global section:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [global] # Retry a restic command that failed on acquiring a lock every minute # (at least), for up to the time specified in "--lock-wait duration". restic-lock-retry-after = "1m" # Ask restic to unlock a stale lock when its age is more than 2 hours # and the option "force-inactive-lock" is enabled in the profile. restic-stale-lock-age = "2h" version: "1" global: # Retry a restic command that failed on acquiring a lock every minute # (at least), for up to the time specified in "--lock-wait duration". restic-lock-retry-after: 1m # Ask restic to unlock a stale lock when its age is more than 2 hours # and the option "force-inactive-lock" is enabled in the profile. restic-stale-lock-age: 2h "global" = { # Retry a restic command that failed on acquiring a lock every minute # (at least), for up to the time specified in "--lock-wait duration".

"restic-stale-lock-age" = "2h" } { "version": "1", "global": { "restic-lock-retry-after": "1m", "restic-stale-lock-age": "2h" } } If restic lock management is not desired, it can be disabled by setting both values to 0.

A few environment variables will be set before running these commands:
PROFILE_NAME PROFILE_COMMAND: backup, check, forget, etc. Additionally, for the run-after-fail commands, these environment variables will also be available:
ERROR_MESSAGE (and ERROR) containing the latest error message ERROR_COMMANDLINE containing the command line that failed ERROR_EXIT_CODE containing the exit code of the command line that failed ERROR_STDERR containing any message that the failed command sent to the standard error (stderr) The commands of run-finally get the environment of run-after-fail when run-before, run-after or restic failed.
Failures to run commands in run-finally are logged but do not influence environment, return code nor running of further commands listed in run-finally. This makes it the perfect choice for custom cleanup tasks that must always run.
All other command errors (= non-zero return code from a command) will skip running further commands in the same list and/or abort the flow.

It means that the run-after-fail target is not called if the lock cannot be obtained. This is a limitation of the current implementation.
Run commands on stream errors In addition to hooks around profile and command execution, resticprofile allows to monitor the standard error stream of the current running command and trigger a custom hook when an output error line matches a regular expression pattern.
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [default] [[default.stream-error]] pattern = ".+ERROR.+" run = 'echo "Found ERROR at least 5 times in \${PROFILE_COMMAND}. Last matched line:"; cat - ' max-runs = 0 min-matches = 5 version: "1" default: stream-error: - pattern: ".+ERROR.+" run: 'echo "Found ERROR at least 5 times in \${PROFILE_COMMAND}. Last matched line:"; cat - ' max-runs: 0 min-matches: 5 default { stream-error = { pattern = ".+ERROR.+" run = "echo \\"Found ERROR at least 5 times in \${PROFILE_COMMAND}. Last matched line:\\"; cat - " max-runs = 0 min-matches = 5 } } { "version": "1", "default": { "stream-error": [ { "pattern": ".+ERROR.+", "run": "echo \\"Found ERROR at least 5 times in \${PROFILE_COMMAND}. Last matched line:\\"; cat - ", "max-runs": 0, "min-matches": 5 } ] } } The config structure stream-error can be defined multiple times within a profile and consists of the following properties:
pattern: a regular expression pattern matched against every line of stderr. run: the command to run when pattern is found in stderr. max-runs: maximum number of times that run is started for a single monitored command (or 0 for no limit). min-matches: minimum number of times that pattern must match before starting run. The run command inherits the environment of the monitored command on a pattern match, which always includes:
PROFILE_NAME PROFILE_COMMAND: backup, check, forget, etc. Stdin of the run command is populated with the error output line that matched the pattern. Using "cat -" in run effectively prints the line that triggered the action.
The following example shows how this could have been used with restic to address check failures caused by over usage of /tmp/ (restic fixed this problem in 0.14.0):
​ toml yaml version = "1" [default] [[default.stream-error]] pattern = "/tmp/restic-check-cache.+no space left on device" run = "rm -Rf /tmp/restic-check-cache*" [[default.stream-error]] pattern = "mkdir /tmp/restic-check-cache.+no such file or directory" run = "cat - | cut -d : -f 2 - | grep -E 'mkdir /tmp[^ \\\\.]+$' | sed 's/mkdir/mkdir -p/' - | sh" version: "1" default: stream-error: - pattern: "/tmp/restic-check-cache.+no space left on device" run: "rm -Rf /tmp/restic-check-cache*" - pattern: "mkdir /tmp/restic-check-cache.+no such file or directory" run: "cat - | cut -d : -f 2 - | grep -E 'mkdir /tmp[^ \\\\.]+$' | sed 's/mkdir/mkdir -p/' - | sh" `,description:"",tags:null,title:"Command Hooks",uri:"/configuration/run_hooks/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Installation",content:`Once installed, you can easily upgrade resticprofile to the latest release using this command:
resticprofile self-update Package Managers The self-update command is not available when installed via a package manager (homebrew, scoop). You should use the upgrade built in the package manager instead.
resticprofile will check for a new version from GitHub releases and asks you if you want to update to the new version. If you add the flag -q or --quiet to the command line, it will update automatically without asking.
resticprofile --quiet self-updateand since version 0.11.0:
resticprofile self-update --quiet Info On versions before 0.10.0, there was an issue with self-updating from linux with ARM processors (like a raspberry pi). This was fixed in version 0.10.0
`,description:"",tags:null,title:"Upgrade",uri:"/installation/upgrade/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Schedules",content:`resticprofile accepts these internal commands:
schedule unschedule status All internal commands either operate on the profile selected by --name, on the profiles selected by a group, or on all profiles when the flag --all is passed.
Examples:
resticprofile --name profile schedule resticprofile --name group schedule resticprofile schedule --all Please note, schedules are always independent of each other no matter whether they have been created with --all, by group or from a single profile.
schedule command Install all the schedules defined on the selected profile or profiles.
Please note on systemd, we need to start the timer once to enable it. Otherwise it will only be enabled on the next reboot. If you dont’ want to start (and enable) it now, pass the --no-start flag to the command line.
Also if you use the --all flag to schedule all your profiles at once, make sure you use only the user mode or system mode. A combination of both would not schedule the tasks properly:
if the user is not privileged, only the user tasks will be scheduled if the user is privileged, all schedule will end-up as a system schedule unschedule command Remove all the schedules defined on the selected profile or profiles.
status command Print the status on all the installed schedules of the selected profile or profiles.
The display of the status command will be OS dependant. Please refer to the examples on which output you can expect from it.

PROFILE_NAME PROFILE_COMMAND: backup, check, forget, etc. Additionally, for the send-after-fail hooks, these environment variables will be available:
ERROR containing the latest error message ERROR_COMMANDLINE containing the command line that failed ERROR_EXIT_CODE containing the exit code of the command line that failed ERROR_STDERR containing any message that the failed command sent to the standard error (stderr) The send-finally hooks are also getting the environment of send-after-fail when any previous operation has failed (except any send operation).
Failures in any send-* are logged but do not influence environment or return code.
order of send-* Here’s the flow of HTTP hooks:
graph TD LOCK(set resticprofile lock) UNLOCK(delete resticprofile lock) LOCK --> SB SB('send-before') --> RUN RUN(run restic command, or group of commands) RUN -->|Success| SA RUN -->|Error| SAF SA('send-after') --> SF SAF('send-after-fail') --> SF SF('send-finally') SF --> UNLOCK resticprofile lock The local resticprofile lock is surrounding the whole process. It means that the run-after-fail target is not called if the lock cannot be obtained. This is a limitation of the current implementation.
body-template You can use a standard go template to build the webhook body. It has to be defined in a separate file (otherwise it would clash with the configuration as a go template itself).
The object passed as an argument to the template is:
ProfileName string ProfileCommand string Error ErrorContext Stdout string The type ErrorContext is available after an error occurred (otherwise all fields are blank):
Message string CommandLine string ExitCode string Stderr string Here’s an example of a body file:
{ "profileName": "{{ .ProfileName }}", "profileCommand": "{{ .ProfileCommand }}", "exitCode": "{{ .Error.ExitCode }}" }The field exitCode will be blank if no error occured.
And here’s an example of a configuration using a body template:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [profile] [profile.backup] source = "/source" [profile.backup.send-finally] method = "POST" url = "https://my/monitoring.example.com/" body-template = "body-template.json" [[profile.backup.send-finally.headers]] name = "Content-Type" value = "application/json" version: "1" profile: backup: source: "/source" send-finally: method: POST url: https://my/monitoring.example.com/ body-template: body-template.json headers: - name: Content-Type value: "application/json" "profile" { "backup" = { "source" = "/source" "send-finally" = { "method" = "POST" "url" = "https://my/monitoring.example.com/" "body-template" = "body-template.json" "headers" = { "name" = "Content-Type" "value" = "application/json" } } } } { "version": "1", "profile": { "backup": { "source": "/source", "send-finally": { "method": "POST", "url": "https://my/monitoring.example.com/", "body-template": "body-template.json", "headers": [ { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" } ] } } } } Self-signed certificates If your monitoring system is using self-signed certificates, you can import them in resticprofile (and you don’t need to rely on the skip-tls-verification flag)
The parameter is in the global section and is called ca-certificates: it contains a list of certificate files (PEM).
timeout The default timeout for all HTTP requests is 30 seconds.
You can change the default timeout in the global section with a parameter called send-timeout.
The format is like:
30s 2m 1m20s global configuration example ​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [global] send-timeout = "10s" ca-certificates = [ "ca-chain.cert.pem" ] version: "1" global: send-timeout: 10s ca-certificates: - ca-chain.cert.pem global { send-timeout = "10s" ca-certificates = "ca-chain.cert.pem" } { "version": "1", "global": { "send-timeout": "10s", "ca-certificates": [ "ca-chain.cert.pem" ] } } `,description:"",tags:["v0.18.0"],title:"HTTP Hooks",uri:"/configuration/http_hooks/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Using resticprofile",content:` Info This section is mostly copied from the restic documentation:
Backing up your system without running restic as root
Backing up your system without running resticprofile as root Creating a complete backup of a machine requires a privileged process that is able to read all files. On UNIX-like systems this is traditionally the root user. Processes running as root have superpower. They cannot only read all files but do also have the power to modify the system in any possible way.
With great power comes great responsibility. If a process running as root malfunctions, is exploited, or simply configured in a wrong way it can cause any possible damage to the system. This means you only want to run programs as root that you trust completely. And even if you trust a program, it is good and common practice to run it with the least possible privileges.
Capabilities on Linux Fortunately, Linux has functionality to divide root’s power into single separate capabilities. You can remove these from a process running as root to restrict it. And you can add capabilities to a process running as a normal user, which is what we are going to do.
Full backup without root To be able to completely backup a system, restic has to read all the files. Luckily Linux knows a capability that allows precisely this. We can assign this single capability to restic and then run it as an unprivileged user.
First we create a new user called restic that is going to create the backups:
useradd --system --create-home --shell /sbin/nologin resticThen we download and install the resticprofile and restic binary into the user’s home directory (please refer to the respective installation sections). Let’s save both binaries in the ~/bin directory.
Before we assign any special capability to the binaries, we restrict their permissions so that only root and the newly created restic user can execute them. Otherwise another - possibly untrusted - user could misuse the privileged binaries to circumvent file access controls.
chown root:restic ~restic/bin/restic chmod 750 ~restic/bin/restic chown root:restic ~restic/bin/resticprofile chmod 750 ~restic/bin/resticprofileFinally we can use setcap to add an extended attribute to the binaries. On every execution the system will read the extended attribute, interpret it and assign capabilities accordingly.
setcap cap_dac_read_search=+ep ~restic/bin/restic setcap cap_dac_read_search=pie ~restic/bin/resticprofile Warning The capabilities of the setcap command only applies to this specific copy of the binaries. If you run restic self-update or in any other way replace or update the binaries, the capabilities you added above will not be in effect for the new binaries. To mitigate this, simply run the setcap commands again, to make sure that the new binaries have the same and intended capabilities.
From now on the user restic can run resticprofile to backup the whole system.
sudo -u restic /home/restic/bin/resticprofile backup`,description:"",tags:null,title:"No root backup on Linux",uri:"/usage/noroot/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Configuration file",content:`Templates are a great way to compose configuration profiles.
Please keep in mind that yaml files are sensitive to the number of spaces. Also if you declare a block already declared, it overrides the previous declaration (instead of merging them).
For that matter, configuration templates are probably more useful if you use the toml or hcl configuration format.
Here’s a simple example
{{ define "hello" }} hello = "world" {{ end }}To use the content of this template anywhere in your configuration, simply call it:
{{ template "hello" . }}Note the dot after the name: it’s used to pass the variables to the template. Without it, all your variables (like .Profile.Name) would display <no value>.

We will see it in action in a moment.
Limitations of using templates There’s something to be aware of when dealing with templates: at the time the template is compiled, it has no knowledge of what the end configuration should look like: it has no knowledge of profiles for example. Here is a non-working example of what I mean:
version = "1" {{ define "retention" }} [{{ .Profile.Name }}.retention] after-backup = true before-backup = false compact = false keep-within = "30d" prune = true {{ end }} [src] password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key" repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}" lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock" initialize = true [src.backup] source = "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src" check-before = true exclude = ["/**/.git"] exclude-caches = true tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"] {{ template "retention" . }} [src.snapshots] tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"] [other] password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key" repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}" lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock" initialize = true {{ template "retention" . }}Here we define a template retention that we use twice. When you ask for a configuration of a profile, either src or other the template will change all occurrences of { .Profile.Name } to the name of the profile, no matter where it is inside the file.
% resticprofile -c examples/parse-error.toml -n src show 2020/11/06 21:39:48 cannot load configuration file: cannot parse toml configuration: While parsing config: (35, 6): duplicated tables exit status 1Run the command again, this time asking a display of the compiled version of the configuration:

They could be both called [src.retention], but actually the reason why they’re both called [default.retention] is that resticprofile is doing a first pass to load the [global] section using a profile name of default.
The fix for this configuration is very simple though, just remove the section name from the template:
{{ define "retention" }} after-backup = true before-backup = false compact = false keep-within = "30d" prune = true {{ end }} version = "1" [src] password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key" repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}" lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock" initialize = true [src.backup] source = "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src" check-before = true exclude = ["/**/.git"] exclude-caches = true tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"] [src.retention] {{ template "retention" . }} [src.snapshots] tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"] [other] password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key" repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}" lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock" initialize = true [other.retention] {{ template "retention" . }}And now you no longer end up with duplicated sections.
Documentation on template, variable expansion and other configuration scripting There are a lot more you can do with configuration templates. If you’re brave enough, you can read the full documentation of the Go templates.
For a more end-user kind of documentation, you can also read hugo documentation on templates which is using the same Go implementation, but don’t talk much about the developer side of it. Please note there are some functions only made available by hugo though, resticprofile adds its own set of functions.
Template functions resticprofile supports the following set of own functions in all templates:
{{ "some string" | contains "some" }} => true {{ "some string" | matches "^.+str.+$" }} => true {{ "some old string" | replace "old" "new" }} => some new string {{ "some old string" | replaceR "(old)" "$1 and new" }} => some old and new string {{ "some old string" | regex "(old)" "$1 and new" }} => some old and new string (regex is an alias to replaceR) {{ "ABC" | lower }} => abc {{ "abc" | upper }} => ABC {{ " A " | trim }} => A {{ "--A-" | trimPrefix "--" }} => A- {{ "--A-" | trimSuffix "-" }} => --A {{ range $v := "A,B,C" | split "," }} ({{ $v }}) {{ end }} => (A) (B) (C) {{ "A,B,C" | split "," | join ";" }} => A;B;C {{ "A, B, C" | splitR "\\\\s*,\\\\s*" | join ";" }} => A;B;C {{ range $v := list "A" "B" "C" }} ({{ $v }}) {{ end }} => (A) (B) (C) {{ with map "k1" "v1" "k2" "v2" }} {{ .k1 }}-{{ .k2 }} {{ end }} => v1-v2 {{ with list "A" "B" "C" "D" | map }} {{ ._0 }}-{{ ._1 }}-{{ ._3 }} {{ end }} => A-B-D {{ with list "A" "B" "C" "D" | map "key" }} {{ .key | join "-" }} {{ end }} => A-B-C-D {{ tempDir }} => /tmp/resticprofile.../t - unique OS specific existing temporary directory {{ tempFile "filename" }} => /tmp/resticprofile.../t/filename - unique OS specific existing temporary file All {{ temp* }} functions guarantee that returned temporary directories and files are existing & writable. When resticprofile ends, temporary directories and files are removed.
The following functions can be used to encode data (e.g. when dealing with arbitrary input):
{{ "a & b\\n" | js }} => a \\u0026 b\\u000A - JSON string equivalent of the input (builtin) {{ "a & b\\n" | html }} => a &amp; b\\n - HTML text escaped input (builtin) {{ "a & b\\n" | urlquery }} => a+%26+b%0A - URL query escaped input (builtin) {{ "plain" | base64 }} => cGxhaW4= - Base64 encoded input {{ "plain" | hex }} => 706c61696e - Hexadecimal encoded input Encode with js when creating strings in YAML, TOML or JSON configuration files, e.g.: "{{ .Env.MyVar | js }}". This ensures the markup remains correct and can be parsed regardless of the input data.
Please refer to the official documentation for the general syntax and set of default functions provided in go text templates.
`,description:"",tags:null,title:"Templates",uri:"/configuration/templates/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Configuration file",content:`Variable expansion in configuration file You might want to reuse the same configuration (or bits of it) on different environments. One way of doing it is to create a generic configuration where specific bits can be replaced by a variable.
There are two kinds of variables: template variables: These variables are fixed once the full configuration file is loaded: includes are loaded, and inheritance is resolved. These variables are replaced by their value before the configuration is parsed. runtime variables: These variables are replaced by their value after the configuration is parsed. In other words: these variables are replaced by their value just before the command is executed. Template variables Pre-defined variables The syntax for using a pre-defined variable is:
{{ .VariableName }}The list of pre-defined variables is:
Variable Type Description .Profile.Name string Profile name .Now time.Time object Now object: see explanation bellow .StartupDir string Current directory at the time resticprofile was started .CurrentDir string Current directory at the time a profile is executed .ConfigDir string Directory where the configuration was loaded from .TempDir string OS temporary directory (might not exist) .BinaryDir string Directory where resticprofile was started from (since v0.18.0) .OS string GOOS name: “windows”, “linux”, “darwin”, etc. (since v0.21.0) .Arch string GOARCH name: “386”, “amd64”, “arm64”, etc. (since v0.21.0) .Hostname string Host name .Env.{NAME} string Environment variable \${NAME} Environment variables are accessible using .Env. followed by the (upper case) name of the environment variable.
Example: {{ .Env.HOME }} will be replaced by your home directory (on unixes). The equivalent on Windows would be {{ .Env.USERPROFILE }}.
Default and fallback values for an empty or unset variable can be declared with {{ ... | or ... }}. For example {{ .Env.HOME | or .Env.USERPROFILE | or "/fallback-homedir" }} will try to resolve $HOME, if empty try to resolve $USERPROFILE and finally default to /fallback-homedir if none of the env variables are defined.
The variables .OS and .Arch are filled with the target platform that resticprofile was compiled for (see releases for more information on existing precompiled platform binaries).
For variables that are objects, you can call all public fields or methods on it. For example, for the variable .Now (time.Time) you can use:
(.Now.AddDate years months days) .Now.Day .Now.Format layout .Now.Hour .Now.Minute .Now.Month .Now.Second .Now.UTC .Now.Unix .Now.Weekday .Now.Year .Now.YearDay Time can be formatted with .Now.Format layout, for example {{ .Now.Format "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00" }} formats the current time as RFC3339 timestamp. Check time.Time#constants for more layout examples.
The variable .Now also allows to derive a relative Time. For example {{ (.Now.AddDate 0 -6 -14).Format "2006-01-02" }} formats a date that is 6 months and 14 days before now.
Example You can use a combination of inheritance and variables in the resticprofile configuration file like so:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [generic] password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key" repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}" lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock" initialize = true [generic.backup] check-before = true exclude = [ "/**/.git" ] exclude-caches = true one-file-system = false run-after = "echo All Done!" run-before = [ "echo Hello {{ .Env.LOGNAME }}", "echo current dir: {{ .CurrentDir }}", "echo config dir: {{ .ConfigDir }}", "echo profile started at {{ .Now.Format "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST" }}" ] tag = [ "{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev" ] [generic.retention] after-backup = true before-backup = false compact = false keep-within = "30d" prune = true tag = [ "{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev" ] [generic.snapshots] tag = [ "{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev" ] [src] inherit = "generic" [src.backup] source = [ "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src" ] [src.check] # Weekday is an integer from 0 to 6 (starting from Sunday) # Nice trick to add 1 to an integer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72465098 read-data-subset = "{{ len (printf "a%*s" .Now.Weekday "") }}/7" --- version: "1" generic: password-file: "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key" repository: "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}" lock: "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock" initialize: true backup: check-before: true exclude: - /**/.git exclude-caches: true one-file-system: false run-after: echo All Done! run-before: - "echo Hello {{ .Env.LOGNAME }}" - "echo current dir: {{ .CurrentDir }}" - "echo config dir: {{ .ConfigDir }}" - "echo profile started at {{ .Now.Format "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST" }}" tag: - "{{ .Profile.Name }}" - dev retention: after-backup: true before-backup: false compact: false keep-within: 30d prune: true tag: - "{{ .Profile.Name }}" - dev snapshots: tag: - "{{ .Profile.Name }}" - dev src: inherit: generic backup: source: - "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src" check: # Weekday is an integer from 0 to 6 (starting from Sunday) # Nice trick to add 1 to an integer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72465098 read-data-subset: "{{ len (printf "a%*s" .Now.Weekday "") }}/7" "generic" = { "password-file" = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key" "repository" = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}" "lock" = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock" "initialize" = true "backup" = { "check-before" = true "exclude" = ["/**/.git"] "exclude-caches" = true "one-file-system" = false "run-after" = "echo All Done!" "run-before" = ["echo Hello {{ .Env.LOGNAME }}", "echo current dir: {{ .CurrentDir }}", "echo config dir: {{ .ConfigDir }}", "echo profile started at {{ .Now.Format "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST" }}"] "tag" = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"] } "retention" = { "after-backup" = true "before-backup" = false "compact" = false "keep-within" = "30d" "prune" = true "tag" = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"] } "snapshots" = { "tag" = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"] } } "src" = { "inherit" = "generic" "backup" = { "source" = ["{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src"] } "check" = { # Weekday is an integer from 0 to 6 (starting from Sunday) # Nice trick to add 1 to an integer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72465098 "read-data-subset" = "{{ len (printf "a%*s" .Now.Weekday "") }}/7" } } { "version": "1", "generic": { "password-file": "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key", "repository": "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}", "lock": "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock", "initialize": true, "backup": { "check-before": true, "exclude": [ "/**/.git" ], "exclude-caches": true, "one-file-system": false, "run-after": "echo All Done!", "run-before": [ "echo Hello {{ .Env.LOGNAME }}", "echo current dir: {{ .CurrentDir }}", "echo config dir: {{ .ConfigDir }}", "echo profile started at {{ .Now.Format "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST" }}" ], "tag": [ "{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev" ] }, "retention": { "after-backup": true, "before-backup": false, "compact": false, "keep-within": "30d", "prune": true, "tag": [ "{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev" ] }, "snapshots": { "tag": [ "{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev" ] } }, "src": { "inherit": "generic", "backup": { "source": [ "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src" ] }, "check": { "read-data-subset": "{{ len (printf "a%*s" .Now.Weekday "") }}/7" } } } This is obviously not a real world example, but it shows many of the possibilities you can do with variable expansion.
To check the generated configuration, you can use the resticprofile show command:
% resticprofile -c examples/template.yaml -n src show global: default-command: snapshots restic-lock-retry-after: 1m0s restic-stale-lock-age: 2h0m0s min-memory: 100 send-timeout: 30s profile src: repository: /backup/Monday password-file: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/src-key initialize: true lock: /Users/CP/resticprofile-profile-src.lock backup: check-before: true run-before: echo Hello CP echo current dir: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile echo config dir: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples echo profile started at 05 Sep 22 17:39 BST run-after: echo All Done! source: /Users/CP/go/src exclude: /**/.git exclude-caches: true tag: src dev retention: after-backup: true keep-within: 30d path: /Users/CP/go/src prune: true tag: src dev check: read-data-subset: 2/7 snapshots: tag: src devAs you can see, the src profile inherited from the generic profile. The tags {{ .Profile.Name }} got replaced by the name of the current profile src. Now you can reuse the same generic configuration in another profile.
You might have noticed the read-data-subset in the check section which will read a seventh of the data every day, meaning the whole repository data will be checked over a week. You can find more information about this trick.
Hand-made variables You can also define variables yourself. Hand-made variables starts with a $ (PHP anyone?) and get declared and assigned with the := operator (Pascal anyone?).
Info You can only use double quotes " to declare the string, single quotes ' are not allowed. You can also use backticks to declare the string.
Here’s an example:
# declare and assign a value to the variable {{ $name := "something" }} profile: # put the content of the variable here tag: "{{ $name }}" Note Variables are only valid in the file they are declared in. They cannot be shared in files loaded via include.
Variables can be redefined using the = operator. The new value will be used from the point of redefinition to the end of the file.
# declare and assign a value to the variable {{ $name := "something" }} # reassign a new value to the variable {{ $name = "something else" }}Windows path inside a variable Windows path are using backslashes \\ and are interpreted as escape characters in the configuration file. To use a Windows path inside a variable, you have a few options:
you can escape the backslashes with another backslash. you can use forward slashes / instead of backslashes. Windows is able to use forward slashes in paths. you can use the backtick to declare the string instead of a double quote. For example:
# double backslash {{ $path := "C:\\\\Users\\\\CP\\\\Documents" }} # forward slash {{ $path := "C:/Users/CP/Documents" }} # backticks {{ $path := \`C:\\Users\\CP\\Documents\` }}Example Here’s an example of a configuration on Linux where I use a variable $mountpoint set to a USB drive mount point:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [global] priority = "low" {{ $mountpoint := "/mnt/external" }} [default] repository = "local:{{ $mountpoint }}/backup" password-file = "key" run-before = "mount {{ $mountpoint }}" run-after = "umount {{ $mountpoint }}" run-after-fail = "umount {{ $mountpoint }}" [default.backup] exclude-caches = true source = [ "/etc", "/var/lib/libvirt" ] check-after = true version: "1" global: priority: low {{ $mountpoint := "/mnt/external" }} default: repository: 'local:{{ $mountpoint }}/backup' password-file: key run-before: 'mount {{ $mountpoint }}' run-after: 'umount {{ $mountpoint }}' run-after-fail: 'umount {{ $mountpoint }}' backup: exclude-caches: true source: - /etc - /var/lib/libvirt check-after: true global { priority = "low" } {{ $mountpoint := "/mnt/external" }} default { repository = "local:{{ $mountpoint }}/backup" password-file = "key" run-before = "mount {{ $mountpoint }}" run-after = "umount {{ $mountpoint }}" run-after-fail = "umount {{ $mountpoint }}" backup { exclude-caches = true source = [ "/etc", "/var/lib/libvirt" ] check-after = true } } {{ $mountpoint := "/mnt/external" }} { "version": "1", "global": { "priority": "low" }, "default": { "repository": "local:{{ $mountpoint }}/backup", "password-file": "key", "run-before": "mount {{ $mountpoint }}", "run-after": "umount {{ $mountpoint }}", "run-after-fail": "umount {{ $mountpoint }}", "backup": { "exclude-caches": true, "source": [ "/etc", "/var/lib/libvirt" ], "check-after": true } } } Runtime variable expansion Variable expansion as described in the previous section using the {{ .Var }} syntax refers to template variables that are expanded prior to parsing the configuration file. This means they must be used carefully to create correct config markup, but they are also very flexible.
There is also unix style variable expansion using the \${variable} or $variable syntax on configuration values that expand after the config file was parsed. Values that take a file path or path expression and a few others support this expansion.
If not specified differently, these variables resolve to the corresponding environment variable or to an empty value if no such environment variable exists. Exceptions are mixins where $variable style is used for parametrisation and the profile config flag prometheus-push-job.
Example Backup current dir ($PWD) but prevent backup of $HOME where the repository is located:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [default] repository = "local:\${HOME}/backup" password-file = "\${HOME}/backup.key" [default.backup] source = "$PWD" exclude = ["$HOME/**", ".*", "~*"] version: "1" default: repository: 'local:\${HOME}/backup' password-file: '\${HOME}/backup.key' backup: source: '$PWD' exclude: ['$HOME/**', '.*', '~*'] default { repository = "local:\${HOME}/backup" password-file = "\${HOME}/backup.key" backup { source = [ "$PWD" ] exclude = [ "$HOME/**", ".*", "~*" ] } } { "default": { "repository": "local:\${HOME}/backup", "password-file": "\${HOME}/backup.key", "backup": { "source": [ "$PWD" ], "exclude": [ "$HOME/**", ".*", "~*" ] } } } Use $$ to escape a single $ in configuration values that support variable expansion. E.g. on Windows you might want to exclude $RECYCLE.BIN. Specify it as: exclude = ["$$RECYCLE.BIN"].

docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/resticprofile -h my-hostname creativeprojects/resticprofile -n profile backupPlatforms Starting from version 0.18.0, the resticprofile docker image is available in these 2 platforms:
linux/amd64 linux/arm64/v8 (compatible with raspberry pi 64bits) rclone Starting from version 0.18.0, the resticprofile docker image also includes rclone.
Release cycle on docker hub The docker image is uploaded automatically on docker hub when a new release is published on github. Also, the latest tag is updated to the latest release.
Every week, the latest image is rebuilt to include the latest updates from restic, rclone and the base image (alpine).
Another image is also updated after every commit on the main branch. It’s tagged with nightly. Please be aware that this image might be unstable and should not be used in production.
Scheduling with docker compose There’s an example in the contribution section how to schedule backups in a long running container. The configuration needs to specify crond as a scheduler.

Under macOS, resticprofile is asking if you want to start a profile right now so you can give the access needed to the task, which consists on a few popup windows (you can disable this behavior by adding the flag --no-start after the schedule command).
Here’s an example of scheduling a backup to Azure (which needs network access):

It means it will get equal share of the resources with other processes.
You can lower the priority of restic to avoid slowing down other processes. This is especially useful when you run restic on a production server.
Nice You can use these values for the priority parameter:
String value “nice” equivalent on unixes Idle 19 Background 15 Low 10 Normal 0 High -10 Highest -20 IO Nice This setting is only available on Linux. It allows you to set the IO priority of restic. More information about ionice “class” and “level” can be found here.
Examples ​ toml yaml hcl version = "1" [global] # priority is using priority class on windows, and "nice" on unixes priority = "low" # ionice is available on Linux only ionice = true ionice-class = 2 ionice-level = 6 version: "1" global: # priority is using priority class on windows, and "nice" on unixes priority: low # ionice is available on Linux only ionice: true ionice-class: 2 ionice-level: 6 global { # priority is using priority class on windows, and "nice" on unixes priority = "low" # ionice is available on Linux only ionice = true ionice-class = 2 ionice-level = 6 } Warnings In some cases, resticprofile will not be able to set the priority of restic.

You can redirect the logs to a local file, a temporary file or a syslog server.
Destination The log destination syntax is a such:
- redirects all the logs to the console / stdout (is the default log destination) filename redirects all the logs to the local file called filename temp:filename redirects all the logs to a temporary file available during the whole session, and deleted afterwards. tcp://syslog_server:514 or udp://syslog_server:514 redirects all the logs to the syslog server. Tip If the location cannot be opened, resticprofile will default to send the logs to the console.
Default You can adjust the default log destination in the global section:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [global] log = "resticprofile.log" version: "1" global: log: "resticprofile.log" "global" { "log" = "resticprofile.log" } { "version": "1", "global": { "log": "resticprofile.log" } } Command line You can redirect the logs on the command line with the --log flag:
resticprofile --log backup.log backupOn a schedule You can keep the logs displayed on the console when you run resticprofile commands manually, but send the logs somewhere else when resticprofile is started from a schedule.
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [profile] [profile.backup] schedule = "*:00,30" schedule-priority = "background" schedule-log = "profile-backup.log" version: "1" profile: backup: schedule: '*:00,30' schedule-priority: background schedule-log: profile-backup.log "profile" "backup" { "schedule" = "*:00,30" "schedule-priority" = "background" "schedule-log" = "profile-backup.log" } { "version": "1", "profile": { "backup": { "schedule": "*:00,30", "schedule-priority": "background", "schedule-log": "profile-backup.log" } } } Send logs to a temporary file This can be done by using the template function tempFile.

Section profile.copy This section configures restic command copy available since 0.10.0 . Information on command and flags is copied from the restic manual pages.
The “copy” command copies one or more snapshots from one repository to another.
NOTE: This process will have to both download (read) and upload (write) the entire snapshot(s) due to the different encryption keys used in the source and destination repositories. This /may incur higher bandwidth usage and costs/ than expected during normal backup runs.
NOTE: The copying process does not re-chunk files, which may break deduplication between the files copied and files already stored in the destination repository. This means that copied files, which existed in both the source and destination repository, /may occupy up to twice their space/ in the destination repository. This can be mitigated by the “–copy-chunker-params” option when initializing a new destination repository using the “init” command.
Flags used by resticprofile only: Name Type Default Notes initialize true / false false Initialize the secondary repository if missing initialize-copy-chunker-params true / false true Copy chunker parameters when initializing the secondary repository key-hint string Key ID of key to try decrypting the destination repository first password-command string Shell command to obtain the destination repository password from password-file string File to read the destination repository password from repository string Destination repository to copy snapshots to repository-file string File from which to read the destination repository location to copy snapshots to run-after one or more strings Run shell command(s) after a successful restic command run-after-fail one or more strings Run shell command(s) after failed restic or shell commands run-before one or more strings Run shell command(s) before a restic command run-finally one or more strings Run shell command(s) always, after all other commands schedule one or more strings Set the times at which the scheduled command is run (times are specified in systemd timer format).

Section profile.ls This section configures restic command ls . Information on command and flags is copied from the restic manual pages.
The “ls” command lists files and directories in a snapshot.
The special snapshot ID “latest” can be used to list files and directories of the latest snapshot in the repository. The –host flag can be used in conjunction to select the latest snapshot originating from a certain host only.
File listings can optionally be filtered by directories. Any positional arguments after the snapshot ID are interpreted as absolute directory paths, and only files inside those directories will be listed. If the –recursive flag is used, then the filter will allow traversing into matching directories’ subfolders. Any directory paths specified must be absolute (starting with a path separator); paths use the forward slash ‘/’ as separator.

Section profile.mount This section configures restic command mount . Information on command and flags is copied from the restic manual pages.
The “mount” command mounts the repository via fuse to a directory. This is a read-only mount.
If you need a different template for directories that contain snapshots, you can pass a time template via –time-template and path templates via –path-template.
Example time template without colons:
–time-template “2006-01-02_15-04-05”
You need to specify a sample format for exactly the following timestamp:
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006
For details please see the documentation for time.Format() at: https://godoc.org/time#Time.Format
For path templates, you can use the following patterns which will be replaced: %i by short snapshot ID %I by long snapshot ID %u by username %h by hostname %t by tags %T by timestamp as specified by –time-template
The default path templates are: “ids/%i” “snapshots/%T” “hosts/%h/%T” “tags/%t/%T”

Section profile.retention This section configures restic command forget . Information on command and flags is copied from the restic manual pages.
The “forget” command removes snapshots according to a policy. All snapshots are first divided into groups according to “–group-by”, and after that the policy specified by the “–keep-*” options is applied to each group individually.
Please note that this command really only deletes the snapshot object in the repository, which is a reference to data stored there. In order to remove the unreferenced data after “forget” was run successfully, see the “prune” command.
Please also read the documentation for “forget” to learn about some important security considerations.

Section profile.rewrite This section configures restic command rewrite available since 0.15.0 . Information on command and flags is copied from the restic manual pages.
The “rewrite” command excludes files from existing snapshots. It creates new snapshots containing the same data as the original ones, but without the files you specify to exclude. All metadata (time, host, tags) will be preserved.
The snapshots to rewrite are specified using the –host, –tag and –path options, or by providing a list of snapshot IDs. Please note that specifying neither any of these options nor a snapshot ID will cause the command to rewrite all snapshots.
The special tag ‘rewrite’ will be added to the new snapshots to distinguish them from the original ones, unless –forget is used. If the –forget option is used, the original snapshots will instead be directly removed from the repository.
Please note that the –forget option only removes the snapshots and not the actual data stored in the repository. In order to delete the no longer referenced data, use the “prune” command.

Section profile.stats This section configures restic command stats . Information on command and flags is copied from the restic manual pages.
The “stats” command walks one or multiple snapshots in a repository and accumulates statistics about the data stored therein. It reports on the number of unique files and their sizes, according to one of the counting modes as given by the –mode flag.
It operates on all snapshots matching the selection criteria or all snapshots if nothing is specified. The special snapshot ID “latest” is also supported. Some modes make more sense over just a single snapshot, while others are useful across all snapshots, depending on what you are trying to calculate.
The modes are:
restore-size: (default) Counts the size of the restored files. files-by-contents: Counts total size of files, where a file is considered unique if it has unique contents. raw-data: Counts the size of blobs in the repository, regardless of how many files reference them. blobs-per-file: A combination of files-by-contents and raw-data.
Refer to the online manual for more details about each mode.

Schema URLs JSON schema URLs for any restic version:
Config V1: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-1.json Config V2: https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-2.json These universal schemas contain all flags and commands of all known restic versions and may allow to set flags that are not supported by a particular restic version. Descriptions and deprecation markers indicate what is supported and what should no longer be used.
JSON schema URLs for a specific restic version (list of available URLs):
.../config-1-restic-{MAJOR}-{MINOR}.json .../config-2-restic-{MAJOR}-{MINOR}.json These schemas contain only flags and commands of a specific restic version. The schema will validate a config only when flags are used that the selected restic version supports according to its manual pages.
As an alternative to URLs, schemas can be generated locally with: resticprofile generate --json-schema [--version RESTIC_VERSION] [v2|v1]
Usage (vscode) To use a schema with vscode, begin your config files with:
​ toml yaml json #:schema https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-2.json version = "2" # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-2.json version: "2" { "$schema": "https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/jsonschema/config-2.json", "version": "2" } YAML & TOML validation with JSON schema is not supported out of the box. Additional extensions are required.
Example
Extension: redhat.vscode-yaml
`,description:"",tags:["v0.21.0"],title:"JSON schema",uri:"/configuration/jsonschema/index.html"},{breadcrumb:"Configuration file",content:` Note The configuration file format v2 is in preview right now. You can try to use it since v0.17.0 but it’s for testing and feedback only.
Introduction The current file format was decided at the time resticprofile was only using the toml format. Nesting pieces of configuration in blocks is not the easiest as you have to specify the whole path in the block:
[profile] [profile.backup] source = "some path"Since then, I believe the yaml format is preferred over toml.
My proposal is to make a “version 2” of the configuration file, the current file format is “version 1”.
Both formats will continue to be valid:
if no version is specified, the “version 1” is used. This is the current format if a version is specified (2) the new format will be expected New format availability The new format “version 2” will be available for:
TOML YAML JSON It won’t be available for HCL. This may not be definitive, but it’s not widely used and it’s becoming more and more difficult to support HCL.
HCL can still be used as is, “version = 1”
New format specifications I will show the specification using the yaml as examples, because it’s probably the most readable format.
version version: 2global The global section does not change. We’ll keep all the global configuration in there.
global: default-command: snapshots initialize: false priority: lowprofiles All your profiles will be nested under a profiles section. Please note the schedules are no longer described inside the profile, but in a separate section schedules (see the following example).
version: "2" profiles: default: env: tmp: /tmp password-file: key repository: /backup documents: inherit: default backup: source: ~/Documents snapshots: tag: - documentsgroups The list of profiles will be nested under a profiles section, so we can add more configuration to groups later.
version: "2" groups: full: # name of your group profiles: - root - documents - mysqlschedules A new schedule section could schedule either a group or a list of profiles.
version: "2" schedules: full-backup: # give a name to your schedule group: full schedule: - "Mon..Fri *:00,15,30,45" # every 15 minutes on weekdays permission: user run: backup # backup is the default if not specified other: profiles: - root - mysql schedule: - "Sat,Sun 0,12:00" # twice a day on week-ends permission: user run: pruneThis format leaves more space for improvements later (like a repos section maybe?)
Tip You can participate in designing the “version 2” here

User systemd units are created under the user’s systemd profile (~/.config/systemd/user).
System units are created in /etc/systemd/system
systemd calendars resticprofile uses systemd OnCalendar format to schedule events.
Testing systemd calendars can be done with the systemd-analyze application. systemd-analyze will display when the next trigger will happen:
systemd-analyze calendar 'daily' Original form: daily Normalized form: *-*-* 00:00:00 Next elapse: Sat 2020-04-18 00:00:00 CDT (in UTC): Sat 2020-04-18 05:00:00 UTC From now: 10h leftFirst time schedule When you schedule a profile with the schedule command, under the hood resticprofile will
create the unit file (of type notify) create the timer file run systemctl daemon-reload (only if schedule-permission is set to system) run systemctl enable run systemctl start Run after the network is up Specifying the profile option schedule-after-network-online: true means that the scheduled services will wait for a network connection before running. This is done via an After=network-online.target entry in the service.
systemd drop-in files It is possible to automatically populate *.conf.d drop-in files for profiles, which allows easy overriding of the generated services, without modifying the service templates. For example:
​ toml yaml hcl json version = "1" [root] systemd-drop-in-files = ["99-drop-in-example.conf"] [root.backup] schedule = "hourly" schedule-permission = "system" schedule-lock-wait = "45m" schedule-after-network-online = true --- version: 1 root: systemd-drop-in-files: - "99-drop-in-example.conf" backup: schedule: hourly schedule-permission: system schedule-lock-wait: 45m schedule-after-network-online: true "version" = "1" "root" = { "systemd-drop-in-files" = ["99-drop-in-example.conf"] "backup" = { "schedule" = "hourly" "schedule-permission" = "system" "schedule-lock-wait" = "45m" "schedule-after-network-online" = true } } { "version": "1", "root": { "systemd-drop-in-files": ["99-drop-in-example.conf"], "backup": { "schedule": "hourly", "schedule-permission": "system", "schedule-lock-wait": "45m", "schedule-after-network-online": true } } } Where 99-drop-in-example.conf is in the same directory as profiles.toml and with the contents

Since version 0.16.0, you now can describe your own templates if you need to add things in it (typically like sending an email on failure).
The format used is a go template and you need to specify your own unit and/or timer file in the global section of the configuration (it will apply to all your profiles):
​ toml yaml hcl json [global] systemd-unit-template = "service.tmpl" systemd-timer-template = "timer.tmpl" --- global: systemd-unit-template: service.tmpl systemd-timer-template: timer.tmpl "global" = { "systemd-unit-template" = "service.tmpl" "systemd-timer-template" = "timer.tmpl" } { "global": { "systemd-unit-template": "service.tmpl", "systemd-timer-template": "timer.tmpl" } } Here are the defaults if you don’t specify your own (which I recommend to use as a starting point for your own templates)

User agent A user agent is generated when you set schedule-permission to user.
It consists of a plist file in the folder ~/Library/LaunchAgents:
A user agent mostly runs with the privileges of the user. But if you backup some specific files, like your contacts or your calendar for example, you will need to give more permissions to resticprofile and restic.
For this to happen, you need to start the agent or daemon from a console window first (resticprofile will ask if you want to do so)
If your profile is a backup profile called remote, the command to run manually is:
launchctl start local.resticprofile.remote.backupOnce you grant the permission, the background agents/daemon will be able to run normally.
There’s some information in this thread: https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2051
TODO: I’m going to try to compile a comprehensive how-to guide from all the information from the thread. Stay tuned!
Special case of schedule-permission=user with sudo Please note if you schedule a user agent while running resticprofile with sudo: the user agent will be registered to the root user, and not your initial user context. It means you can only see it (status) and remove it (unschedule) via sudo.
Daemon A launchd daemon is generated when you set schedule-permission to system.
It consists of a plist file in the folder /Library/LaunchDaemons. You have to run resticprofile with sudo to schedule, check the status and unschedule the profile.
