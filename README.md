# resticprofile
Configuration profiles manager for [restic backup](https://restic.net/)

**resticprofile** is the missing link between a configuration file and restic backup. Creating a configuration file for restic has been [discussed before](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/16), but seems to be a very low priority right now.

With resticprofile:

* You no longer need to remember command parameters and environment variables
* You can create multiple profiles inside one configuration file
* A profile can inherit all the options from another profile
* You can run the forget command before or after a backup (in a section called *retention*)
* You can check a repository before or after a backup
* You can create groups of profiles that will run sequentially
* You can run shell commands before or after running a profile: useful if you need to mount and unmount your backup disk for example
* You can run a shell command if an error occurred (at any time)
* You can send a backup stream via _stdin_
* You can start restic at a lower or higher priority (Priority Class in Windows, *nice* in all unixes) and/or _ionice_ (only available on Linux)
* It can check that you have enough memory before starting a backup. (I've had some backups that literally killed a server with swap disabled)
* You can generate cryptographically secure random keys to use as a restic key file
* You can easily schedule backups, retentions and checks (works for *systemd*, *crond*, *launchd* and *windows task scheduler*)
* You can generate a simple status file to send to some monitoring software and make sure your backups are running fine 
* **[new for v0.10.0]** You can use a template syntax in your configuration file
* **[new for v0.11.0]** You can generate scheduled tasks using *crond*
* **[new for v0.12.0]** Get backup statistics in your status file

The configuration file accepts various formats:
* [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) : configuration file with extension _.toml_ and _.conf_ to keep compatibility with versions before 0.6.0
* [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) : configuration file with extension _.json_
* [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) : configuration file with extension _.yaml_
* [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl): configuration file with extension _.hcl_

For the rest of the documentation, I'll be mostly showing examples using the TOML file configuration format (because it was the only one supported before version 0.6.0) but you can pick your favourite: they all work with resticprofile.

# Requirements

Since version 0.6.0, resticprofile no longer needs python installed on your machine. It is distributed as an executable (same as restic).

It's been actively tested on macOS X and Linux (Debian), and regularly tested on Windows.
Please note I use resticprofile on multiple Debian (and Debian based) distributions (AMD64 and ARM), but **no other distribution**. I also do not use it on FreeBSD.

**This is at _beta_ stage. Please avoid using it in production. Or at least test carefully first. Even though I'm using it on my servers, I cannot guarantee all combinations of configuration are going to work properly for you.**

# Installation (macOS, Linux & other unixes)

Here's a simple script to download the binary automatically. It works on mac OS X, FreeBSD and Linux:

```
$ curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/master/install.sh | sh
```

It should copy resticprofile in a `bin` directory under your current directory.

If you need more control, you can save the shell script and run it manually:

```
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/master/install.sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh -b /usr/local/bin
```

It will install resticprofile in `/usr/local/bin/`


## Installation for Windows using bash

You can use the same script if you're using bash in Windows (via WSL, git bash, etc.)

```
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/master/install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```
It will create a `bin` directory under your current directory and place `resticprofile.exe` in it.

## Manual installation (Windows)

- Download the package corresponding to your system and CPU from the [release page](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/releases)
- Once downloaded you need to open the archive and copy the binary file `resticprofile` (or `resticprofile.exe`) in your PATH.

## Ansible

Installation using Ansible is not supported out of the box yet, but since I'm using it on my servers I thought I could [share the playbook](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/tree/master/contrib/ansible)

# Upgrade

Once installed, you can easily upgrade resticprofile to the latest release using this command:

```
$ resticprofile self-update
```

Versions 0.6.x were using a flag instead, **this is deprecated since version 0.7.0**:

```
$ resticprofile --self-update
```

_Please note on versions before 0.10.0,  there was an issue with self-updating from linux with ARM processors (like a raspberry pi). This was fixed in version 0.10.0_

resticprofile will check for a new version from GitHub releases and asks you if you want to update to the new version. If you add the flag `-q` or `--quiet` to the command line, it will update automatically without asking.

```
$ resticprofile --quiet self-update
```

and since version 0.11.0:

```
$ resticprofile self-update --quiet
```


# Using docker image ##

You can run resticprofile inside a docker container. It is probably the easiest way to install resticprofile (and restic at the same time) and keep it updated.

**But** be aware that you will need to mount your backup source (and destination if it's local) as a docker volume.
Depending on your operating system, the backup might be **slower**. Volumes mounted on a mac OS host are well known for being quite slow.

By default, the resticprofile container starts at `/resticprofile`. So you can feed a configuration this way:

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/examples:/resticprofile creativeprojects/resticprofile
```

You can list your profiles:
```
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/examples:/resticprofile creativeprojects/resticprofile profiles
```

## Container host name

Each time a container is started, it gets assigned a new random name. You should probably force a hostname to your container...

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/resticprofile -h my-machine creativeprojects/resticprofile -n profile backup
```

... or in your configuration:

```toml
[profile]
host = "my-machine"
```


# Configuration format

* A configuration is a set of _profiles_.
* Each profile is in its own `[section]`.
* Inside each profile, you can specify different flags for each command.
* A command definition is `[section.command]`.

All the restic flags can be defined in a section. For most of them you just need to remove the two dashes in front.

To set the flag `--password-file password.txt` you need to add a line like
```
password-file = "password.txt"
```

There's **one exception**: the flag `--repo` is named `repository` in the configuration

Let's say you normally use this command:

```
restic --repo "local:/backup" --password-file "password.txt" --verbose backup /home
```

For resticprofile to generate this command automatically for you, here's the configuration file (in *TOML* format):

```toml
[default]
repository = "local:/backup"
password-file = "password.txt"

[default.backup]
verbose = true
source = [ "/home" ]
```

or the YAML version if you prefer so:

```yaml
---
default:
  repository: "local:/backup"
  password-file: "password.txt"

  backup:
    verbose: true
    source:
    - "/home"
```


You may have noticed the `source` flag is accepting an array of values (inside brackets in TOML, list of values in YAML)

Now, assuming this configuration file is named `profiles.conf` in the current folder, you can simply run

```
resticprofile backup
```

# Configuration examples

Here's a simple configuration file using a Microsoft Azure backend:

## Simple TOML configuration
```toml
[default]
repository = "azure:restic:/"
password-file = "key"
option = "azure.connections=3"

[default.env]
AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME = "my_storage_account"
AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY = "my_super_secret_key"

[default.backup]
exclude-file = "excludes"
exclude-caches = true
one-file-system = true
tag = [ "root" ]
source = [ "/", "/var" ]
```

## Simple YAML configuration
```yaml
default:
  repository: "azure:restic:/"
  password-file: "key"
  option: "azure.connections=3"

  env:
    AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME: "my_storage_account"
    AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY: "my_super_secret_key"

  backup:
    exclude-file: "excludes"
    exclude-caches: true
    one-file-system: true
    tag:
    - "root"
    source:
    - "/"
    - "/var"
```

## More complex configuration in TOML

Here's a more complex configuration file showing profile inheritance and two backup profiles using the same repository:

```toml
[global]
# ionice is available on Linux only
ionice = false
ionice-class = 2
ionice-level = 6
# priority is using priority class on windows, and "nice" on unixes - it's acting on CPU usage only
priority = "low"
# run 'snapshots' when no command is specified when invoking resticprofile
default-command = "snapshots"
# initialize a repository if none exist at location
initialize = false
# resticprofile won't start a profile if there's less than 100MB of RAM available
min-memory = 100

# a group is a profile that will call all profiles one by one
[groups]
# when starting a backup on profile "full-backup", it will run the "root" and "src" backup profiles
full-backup = [ "root", "src" ]

# Default profile when not specified (-n or --name)
# Please note there's no default inheritance from the 'default' profile (you can use the 'inherit' flag if needed)
[default]
# you can use a relative path, it will be relative to the configuration file
repository = "/backup"
password-file = "key"
initialize = false
# will run these scripts before and after each command (including 'backup')
run-before = "mount /backup"
run-after = "umount /backup"
# if a restic command fails, the run-after won't be running
# add this parameter to run the script in case of a failure
run-after-fail = "umount /backup"

[default.env]
TMPDIR= "/tmp"

[no-cache]
inherit = "default"
no-cache = true
initialize = false

# New profile named 'root'
[root]
inherit = "default"
initialize = true
# this will add a LOCAL lockfile so you cannot run the same profile more than once at a time
# (it's totally independent of the restic locks on the repository)
lock = "/tmp/resticprofile-root.lock"
force-inactive-lock = false

# 'backup' command of profile 'root'
[root.backup]
# files with no path are relative to the configuration file
exclude-file = [ "root-excludes", "excludes" ]
exclude-caches = true
one-file-system = false
tag = [ "test", "dev" ]
source = [ "/" ]
# if scheduled, will run every day at midnight
schedule = "daily"
schedule-permission = "system"
# run this after a backup to share a repository between a user and root (via sudo)
run-after = "chown -R $SUDO_USER $HOME/.cache/restic /backup"

# retention policy for profile root
[root.retention]
before-backup = false
after-backup = true
keep-last = 3
keep-hourly = 1
keep-daily = 1
keep-weekly = 1
keep-monthly = 1
keep-yearly = 1
keep-within = "3h"
keep-tag = [ "forever" ]
compact = false
prune = false
# if path is NOT specified, it will be copied from the 'backup' source
# path = []
# the tags are NOT copied from the 'backup' command
tag = [ "test", "dev" ]
# host can be a boolean ('true' meaning current hostname) or a string to specify a different hostname
host = true

# New profile named 'src'
[src]
inherit = "default"
initialize = true

# 'backup' command of profile 'src'
[src.backup]
exclude = [ '/**/.git' ]
exclude-caches = true
one-file-system = false
tag = [ "test", "dev" ]
source = [ "./src" ]
check-before = true
# will only run these scripts before and after a backup
run-before = [ "echo Starting!", "ls -al ./src" ]
run-after = "sync"
# if scheduled, will run every 30 minutes
schedule = "*:0,30"
schedule-permission = "user"

# retention policy for profile src
[src.retention]
before-backup = false
after-backup = true
keep-within = "30d"
compact = false
prune = true

# check command of profile src
[src.check]
read-data = true
# if scheduled, will check the repository the first day of each month at 3am
schedule = "*-*-01 03:00"

```

## TOML configuration example for Windows

And another simple example for Windows:

```toml
[global]
restic-binary = "c:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\\restic.exe"

# Default profile when not specified (-n or --name)
# Please note there's no default inheritance from the 'default' profile (you can use the 'inherit' flag if needed)
[default]
repository = "local:r:/"
password-file = "key"
initialize = false

# New profile named 'test'
[test]
inherit = "default"
initialize = true

# 'backup' command of profile 'test'
[test.backup]
tag = [ "windows" ]
source = [ "c:\\" ]
check-after = true
run-before = "dir /l"
run-after = "echo All Done!"

```

### Use stdin in configuration

Simple example sending a file via stdin

```toml

[stdin]
repository = "local:/backup/restic"
password-file = "key"

[stdin.backup]
stdin = true
stdin-filename = "stdin-test"
tag = [ 'stdin' ]

```

# Configuration paths

The default name for the configuration file is `profiles`, without an extension.
You can change the name and its path with the `--config` or `-c` option on the command line.
You can set a specific extension `-c profiles.conf` to load a TOML format file.
If you set a filename with no extension instead, resticprofile will load the first file it finds with any of these extensions:
- .conf (toml format)
- .yaml
- .toml
- .json
- .hcl

## macOS X

resticprofile will search for your configuration file in these folders:
- _current directory_
- ~/Library/Preferences/resticprofile/
- /Library/Preferences/resticprofile/
- /usr/local/etc/
- /usr/local/etc/restic/
- /usr/local/etc/resticprofile/
- /etc/
- /etc/restic/
- /etc/resticprofile/
- /opt/local/etc/
- /opt/local/etc/restic/
- /opt/local/etc/resticprofile/
- ~/ ($HOME directory)

## Other unixes (Linux and BSD)

resticprofile will search for your configuration file in these folders:
- _current directory_
- ~/.config/resticprofile/
- /etc/xdg/resticprofile/
- /usr/local/etc/
- /usr/local/etc/restic/
- /usr/local/etc/resticprofile/
- /etc/
- /etc/restic/
- /etc/resticprofile/
- /opt/local/etc/
- /opt/local/etc/restic/
- /opt/local/etc/resticprofile/
- ~/ ($HOME directory)

## Windows

resticprofile will search for your configuration file in these folders:
- _current directory_
- %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\
- c:\ProgramData\
- c:\restic\
- c:\resticprofile\
- %USERPROFILE%\


# Path resolution in configuration

All files path in the configuration are resolved from the configuration path. The big **exception** being `source` in `backup` section where it's resolved from the current path where you started resticprofile.

# Run commands before, after success or after failure

resticprofile has 2 places where you can run commands around restic:

- commands that will run before and after every restic command (snapshots, backup, check, forget, prune, mount, etc.). These are placed at the root of each profile.
- commands that will only run before and after a backup: these are placed in the backup section of your profiles.

Here's an example of all the external commands that you can run during the execution of a profile:

```yaml
documents:
  inherit: default
  run-before: "echo == run-before profile $PROFILE_NAME command $PROFILE_COMMAND"
  run-after: "echo == run-after profile $PROFILE_NAME command $PROFILE_COMMAND"
  run-after-fail: "echo == Error in profile $PROFILE_NAME command $PROFILE_COMMAND: $ERROR"
  backup:
    run-before: "echo === run-before backup profile $PROFILE_NAME command $PROFILE_COMMAND"
    run-after: "echo === run-after backup profile $PROFILE_NAME command $PROFILE_COMMAND"
    source: ~/Documents
```

`run-before`, `run-after` and `run-after-fail` can be a string, or an array of strings if you need to run more than one command

A few environment variables will be set before running these commands:
- `PROFILE_NAME`
- `PROFILE_COMMAND`: backup, check, forget, etc.

Additionally for the `run-after-fail` commands, the `ERROR` environment variable will be set to the latest error message and `ERROR_COMMANDLINE` to the commandline that failed.

## run before and after order during a backup

The commands will be running in this order **during a backup**:
- `run-before` from the profile - if error, go to `run-after-fail`
- `run-before` from the backup section - if error, go to `run-after-fail`
- run the restic backup (with check and retention if configured) - if error, go to `run-after-fail`
- `run-after` from the backup section - if error, go to `run-after-fail`
- `run-after` from the profile - if error, go to `run-after-fail`

# Locks

restic is already using a lock to avoid running some operations at the same time.

Since resticprofile can run several commands in a profile, it could be better to run the whole batch in a lock so nobody can interfere in the meantime.

For this to happen you can specify a lock file in each profile:

```yaml
src:
    lock: "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock"
    backup:
        check-before: true
        exclude:
        - /**/.git
        source:
        - ~/go
    retention:
        after-backup: true
        before-backup: false
        compact: false
        keep-within: 30d
        prune: true
```

For this profile, a lock will be set using the file `/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock` for the duration of the profile: *check*, *backup* and *retention* (via the forget command)

**Please note restic locks and resticprofile locks are completely independant**

In some cases, you might want to override the resticprofile lock if the process died (or the machine rebooted) leaving a lockfile behind.

For that matter, if you add the flag `force-inactive-lock` to your profile, resticprofile will check for the presence of a process with the PID indicated in the lockfile. If it can't find any, it will try to delete the lock and continue the operation (locking again, running profile and so on...)

```yaml
src:
    lock: "/tmp/resticprofile-profile-src.lock"
    force-inactive-lock: true
```


# Using resticprofile

Here are a few examples how to run resticprofile (using the main example configuration file)

See all snapshots of your `[default]` profile:

```
$ resticprofile
```

See all available profiles in your configuration file (and the restic commands where some flags are defined):

```
$ resticprofile profiles

Profiles available:
  stdin:     (backup)
  default:   (env)
  root:      (retention, backup)
  src:       (retention, backup)
  linux:     (retention, backup, snapshots, env)
  no-cache:  (n/a)

Groups available:
  full-backup:  root, src

```

Backup root & src profiles (using _full-backup_ group shown earlier)

```
$ resticprofile --name "full-backup" backup
```

Assuming the _stdin_ profile from the configuration file shown before, the command to send a mysqldump to the backup is as simple as:

```
$ mysqldump --all-databases | resticprofile --name stdin backup
```

Mount the default profile (_default_) in /mnt/restic:

```
$ resticprofile mount /mnt/restic
```

Display quick help

```
$ resticprofile --help

Usage of resticprofile:
	resticprofile [resticprofile flags] [command] [restic flags]

resticprofile flags:
  -c, --config string   configuration file (default "profiles")
      --dry-run         display the restic commands instead of running them
  -f, --format string   file format of the configuration (default is to use the file extension)
  -h, --help            display this help
  -l, --log string      logs into a file instead of the console
  -n, --name string     profile name (default "default")
      --no-ansi         disable ansi control characters (disable console colouring)
      --no-prio         don't set any priority on load: used when started from a service that has already set the priority
  -q, --quiet           display only warnings and errors
      --theme string    console colouring theme (dark, light, none) (default "light")
      --trace           display even more debugging information
  -v, --verbose         display some debugging information
  -w, --wait            wait at the end until the user presses the enter key

resticprofile own commands:
   version       display version (run in verbose mode for detailed information)
   self-update   update to latest resticprofile (use -q/--quiet flag to update without confirmation)
   profiles      display profile names from the configuration file
   show          show all the details of the current profile
   random-key    generate a cryptographically secure random key to use as a restic keyfile
   schedule      schedule jobs from a profile (use --all flag to schedule all jobs of all profiles)
   unschedule    remove scheduled jobs of a profile (use --all flag to unschedule all profiles)
   status        display the status of scheduled jobs (use --all flag for all profiles)


```

A command is either a restic command or a resticprofile own command.


# Command line reference ##

There are not many options on the command line, most of the options are in the configuration file.

* **[-h]**: Display quick help
* **[-c | --config] configuration_file**: Specify a configuration file other than the default
* **[-f | --format] configuration_format**: Specify the configuration file format: `toml`, `yaml`, `json` or `hcl`
* **[-n | --name] profile_name**: Profile section to use from the configuration file
* **[--dry-run]**: Doesn't run the restic command but display the command line instead
* **[-q | --quiet]**: Force resticprofile and restic to be quiet (override any configuration from the profile)
* **[-v | --verbose]**: Force resticprofile and restic to be verbose (override any configuration from the profile)
* **[--no-ansi]**: Disable console colouring (to save output into a log file)
* **[--theme]**: Can be `light`, `dark` or `none`. The colours will adjust to a 
light or dark terminal (none to disable colouring)
* **[-l | --log] log_file**: To write the logs in file instead of displaying on the console
* **[-w | --wait]**: Wait at the very end of the execution for the user to press enter. This is only useful in Windows when resticprofile is started from explorer and the console window closes automatically at the end.
* **[resticprofile OR restic command]**: Like snapshots, backup, check, prune, forget, mount, etc.
* **[additional flags]**: Any additional flags to pass to the restic command line

# Minimum memory required

restic can be memory hungry. I'm running a few servers with no swap (I know: it is _bad_) and I managed to kill some of them during a backup.
For that matter I've introduced a parameter in the `global` section called `min-memory`. The **default value is 100MB**. You can disable it by using a value of `0`.

It compares against `(total - used)` which is probably the best way to know how much memory is available (that is including the memory used for disk buffers/cache).

# Version

The `version` command displays resticprofile version. If run in vebose mode (using `--verbose` flag) additional information such as OS version or golang version or modules are displayed as well.

```
$ resticprofile --verbose version
```

# Generating random keys

resticprofile has a handy tool to generate cryptographically secure random keys encoded in base64. You can simply put this key into a file and use it as a strong key for restic

On Linux and FreeBSD, the generator uses getrandom(2) if available, /dev/urandom otherwise. On OpenBSD, the generator uses getentropy(2). On other Unix-like systems, the generator reads from /dev/urandom. On Windows systems, the generator uses the CryptGenRandom API. On Wasm, the generator uses the Web Crypto API. 
[Reference from the Go documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/#pkg-variables)

```
$ resticprofile random-key
```

generates a 1024 bytes random key (converted into 1368 base64 characters) and displays it on the console

To generate a different size of key, you can specify the bytes length on the command line:

```
$ resticprofile random-key 2048
```

# Scheduled backups

resticprofile is capable of managing scheduled backups for you using:
- **launchd** on macOS X
- **Task Scheduler** on Windows
- **systemd** where available (Linux and other BSDs)
- **crond** on supported platforms (Linux and other BSDs)

On unixes (except macOS) resticprofile is using **systemd** by default. **crond** can be used instead if configured in `global` `scheduler` parameter:

```yaml
---
global:
    scheduler: crond
```



Each profile can be scheduled independently (groups are not available for scheduling yet).

These 4 profile sections are accepting a schedule configuration:
- backup
- check
- forget (version 0.11.0)
- prune (version 0.11.0)

which mean you can schedule `backup`, `forget`, `prune` and `check` independently (I recommend to use a local `lock` in this case).

## retention schedule is deprecated
**Important**:
starting from version 0.11.0 the schedule of the `retention` section is **deprecated**: Use the `forget` section instead.


## Schedule configuration

The schedule configuration consists of a few parameters which can be added on each profile:

```toml
[profile.backup]
schedule = "*:00,30"
schedule-permission = "system"
schedule-log = "profile-backup.log"
```



### schedule-permission

`schedule-permission` accepts two parameters: `user` or `system`:

* `user`: your backup will be running using your current user permissions on files. This is fine if you're only saving your documents (or any other file inside your profile). Please note on **systemd** that the schedule **will only run when your user is logged in**.

* `system`: if you need to access some system or protected files. You will need to run resticprofile with `sudo` on unixes and with elevated prompt on Windows (please note on Windows resticprofile will ask you for elevated permissions automatically if needed).

* *empty*: resticprofile will try its best guess based on how you started it (with sudo or as a normal user) and fallback to `user`

### schedule-log

Allow to redirect all output from resticprofile and restic to a file

### schedule-priority (systemd and launchd only)

Starting from version 0.11.0, `schedule-priority` accepts two values:
- `background`: the process shouldn't be noticeable when working on the machine at the same time (this is the default)
- `standard`: the process should get the same priority as any other process on the machine (but it won't run faster if you're not using the machine at the same time)

`schedule-priority` is not available for windows task scheduler, nor crond

### schedule

The `schedule` parameter accepts many forms of input from the [systemd calendar event](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html#Calendar%20Events) type. This is by far the easiest to use: **It is the same format used to schedule on macOS and Windows**.

The most general form is:
```
weekdays year-month-day hour:minute:second
```

- use `*` to mean any
- use `,` to separate multiple entries
- use `..` for a range

**limitations**:
- the divider (`/`), the `~` and timezones are not (yet?) supported on macOS and Windows.
- the `year` and `second` fields have no effect on macOS. They do have limited availability on Windows (they don't make much sense anyway).

Here are a few examples (taken from the systemd documentation):

```
On the left is the user input, on the right is the full format understood by the system

                   annually → *-01-01 00:00:00
```

The `schedule` can be a string or an array of string (to allow for multiple schedules)

Here's an example of a YAML configuration:

```yaml
default:
    repository: "d:\\backup"
    password-file: key

self:
    inherit: default
    backup:
        source: "."
        schedule:
        - "Mon..Fri *:00,15,30,45" # every 15 minutes on weekdays
        - "Sat,Sun 0,12:00"        # twice a day on week-ends
        schedule-permission: user
    retention:
        schedule: "sun 3:30"
        schedule-permission: user
```

## Scheduling commands

resticprofile accepts these internal commands:
- schedule
- unschedule
- status

All internal commands either operate on the profile selected by `--name`, on the profiles selected by a group, or on all profiles when the flag `--all` is passed.

Examples:
```
resticprofile --name profile schedule 
resticprofile --name group schedule 
resticprofile schedule --all 
```

Please note, schedules are always independent of each other no matter whether they have been created with `--all`, by group or from a single profile.

### schedule command

Install all the schedules defined on the selected profile or profiles.

Please note on systemd, we need to `start` the timer once to enable it. Otherwise it will only be enabled on the next reboot. If you **dont' want** to start (and enable) it now, pass the `--no-start` flag to the command line.

### unschedule command

Remove all the schedules defined on the selected profile or profiles.

### status command

Print the status on all the installed schedules of the selected profile or profiles. 

The display of the `status` command will be OS dependant. Please see the examples below on which output you can expect from it.

### Examples of scheduling commands under Windows

If you create a task with `user` permission under Windows, you will need to enter your password to validate the task. It's a requirement of the task scheduler. I'm inviting you to review the code to make sure I'm not emailing your password to myself. Seriously you shouldn't trust anyone.

Example of the `schedule` command under Windows (with git bash):

```
$ resticprofile -c examples/windows.yaml -n self schedule

### Examples of scheduling commands under macOS

macOS has a very tight protection system when running scheduled tasks (also called agents).

Under macOS, resticprofile is asking if you want to start a profile right now so you can give the access needed to the task, which consists on a few popup windows (you can disable this behavior by adding the flag `--no-start` after the schedule command).

Here's an example of scheduling a backup to Azure (which needs network access):

```
% resticprofile -v -c examples/private/azure.yaml -n self schedule

Analyzing backup schedule 1/1
=================================
  Original form: *:0,15,30,45:00
Normalized form: *-*-* *:00,15,30,45:00
    Next elapse: Tue Jul 28 23:00:00 BST 2020
       (in UTC): Tue Jul 28 22:00:00 UTC 2020
       From now: 2m34s left


By default, a macOS agent access is restricted. If you leave it to start in the background it's likely to fail.
You have to start it manually the first time to accept the requests for access:

% launchctl start local.resticprofile.self.backup

Do you want to start it now? (Y/n):
2020/07/28 22:57:26 scheduled job self/backup created
```

Right after you started the profile, you should get some popup asking you to grant access to various files/folders/network.

If you backup your files to an external repository on a network, you should get this popup window:

!["resticprofile" would like to access files on a network volume](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/raw/master/network_volume.png)

**Note:**
If you prefer not being asked, you can add the `--no-start` flag like so:

```
% resticprofile -v -c examples/private/azure.yaml -n self schedule --no-start
```

## Changing schedule-permission from user to system, or system to user

If you need to change the permission of a schedule, **please be sure to `unschedule` the profile before**.

This order is important:

- `unschedule` the job first. resticprofile does **not** keep track of how your profile **was** installed, so you have to remove the schedule first
- now you can change your permission (`user` to `system`, or `system` to `user`)
- `schedule` your updated profile

# Status file for easy monitoring

If you need to escalate the result of your backup to a monitoring system, you can definitely use the `run-after` and `run-after-fail` scripting.

But sometimes we just need something simple that a monitoring system can regularly check. For that matter, resticprofile can generate a simple JSON file with the details of the latest backup/forget/check command. For example I have a Zabbix agent [checking this file](https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/tree/master/contrib/zabbix) once a day, and so you can hook up any monitoring system that can interpret a JSON file.

In your profile, you simply need to add a new parameter, which is the location of your status file

```toml
[profile]
status-file = "backup-status.json"
```

Here's an example of a generated file, where you can see that the last check failed, whereas the last backup succeeded:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "self": {
      "backup": {
        "success": true,
        "time": "2021-03-17T16:36:56.831077Z",
        "error": "",
        "duration": 2,
        "files_new": 215,
        "files_changed": 0,
        "files_unmodified": 0,
        "dirs_new": 58,
        "dirs_changed": 0,
        "dirs_unmodified": 0,
        "files_total": 215,
        "bytes_added": 296536447,
        "bytes_total": 362952485
      },
      "check": {
        "success": false,
        "time": "2021-03-17T16:34:32.807392Z",
        "error": "exit status 1",
        "duration": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Extended status

On the previous example of a status file you can see some fields like `files_new`, `files_total`, etc. To be able to get this information from restic, you need to add the flag `extended-status` to your backup configuration.

`extended-status` is **not set by default because it hides any output from restic**

```yaml
profile:
    inherit: default
    status-file: /home/backup/status.json
    backup:
        extended-status: true
        source: /go
        exclude:
          - "/**/.git/"

```

# Variable expansion in configuration file

You might want to reuse the same configuration (or bits of it) on different environments. One way of doing it is to create a generic configuration where specific bits will be replaced by a variable.

## Pre-defined variables

The syntax for using a pre-defined variable is:
```
{{ .VariableName }}
```


The list of pre-defined variables is:
- **.Profile.Name** (string)
- **.Now** ([time.Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) object)
- **.CurrentDir** (string)
- **.ConfigDir** (string)
- **.Env.{NAME}** (string)

Environment variables are accessible using `.Env.` followed by the name of the environment variable.

Example: `{{ .Env.HOME }}` will be replaced by your home directory (on unixes). The equivalent on Windows would be `{{ .Env.USERPROFILE }}`.

For variables that are objects, you can call all public field or method on it.
For example, for the variable `.Now` you can use:
- `.Now.Day`
- `.Now.Format layout`
- `.Now.Hour`
- `.Now.Minute`
- `.Now.Month`
- `.Now.Second`
- `.Now.UTC`
- `.Now.Unix`
- `.Now.Weekday`
- `.Now.Year`
- `.Now.YearDay`


## Hand-made variables

But you can also define variables yourself. Hand-made variables starts with a `$` ([PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) anyone?) and get declared and assigned with the `:=` operator ([Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) anyone?). Here's an example:

```yaml
# declare and assign a value to the variable
{{ $name := "something" }}

# put the content of the variable here
tag: "{{ $name }}"
```

## Examples

You can use a combination of inheritance and variables in the resticprofile configuration file like so:

```yaml
---
generic:
    password-file: "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key"
    repository: "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}"
    lock: "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock"
    initialize: true

    backup:
        check-before: true
        exclude:
        - /**/.git
        exclude-caches: true
        one-file-system: false
        run-after: echo All Done!
        run-before:
        - "echo Hello {{ .Env.LOGNAME }}"
        - "echo current dir: {{ .CurrentDir }}"
        - "echo config dir: {{ .ConfigDir }}"
        - "echo profile started at {{ .Now.Format "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST" }}"
        tag:
        - "{{ .Profile.Name }}"
        - dev

    retention:
        after-backup: true
        before-backup: false
        compact: false
        keep-within: 30d
        prune: true
        tag:
        - "{{ .Profile.Name }}"
        - dev

    snapshots:
        tag:
        - "{{ .Profile.Name }}"
        - dev

src:
    inherit: generic
    backup:
        source:
        - "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src"

```

This is obviously not a real world example, but it shows many of the possibilities you can do with variable expansion.

To check the generated configuration, you can use the resticprofile `show` command:

```
% resticprofile -c examples/template.yaml -n src show

global:
    default-command:  snapshots
    restic-binary:    restic
    min-memory:       100


src:
    backup:
        check-before:    true
        run-before:      echo Hello CP
                         echo current dir: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile
                         echo config dir: /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples
                         echo profile started at 04 Nov 20 21:56 GMT
        run-after:       echo All Done!
        source:          /Users/CP/go/src
        tag:             src
                         dev
        exclude:         /**/.git
        exclude-caches:  true

    retention:
        after-backup:  true
        keep-within:   30d
        prune:         true
        tag:           src
                       dev

    repository:     /backup/Wednesday
    password-file:  /Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/src-key
    initialize:     true
    lock:           /Users/CP/resticprofile-profile-src.lock
    snapshots:
        tag:  src
              dev
```

As you can see, the `src` profile inherited from the `generic` profile. The tags `{{ .Profile.Name }}` got replaced by the name of the current profile `src`. Now you can reuse the same generic configuration in another profile.

Here's another example of an HCL configuration on Linux where I use a variable `$mountpoint` set to a USB drive mount point:

```hcl
global {
    priority = "low"
    ionice = true
    ionice-class = 2
    ionice-level = 6
}

{{ $mountpoint := "/mnt/external" }}

default {
    repository = "local:{{ $mountpoint }}/backup"
    password-file = "key"
    run-before = "mount {{ $mountpoint }}"
    run-after = "umount {{ $mountpoint }}"
    run-after-fail = "umount {{ $mountpoint }}"

    backup {
        exclude-caches = true
        source = [ "/etc", "/var/lib/libvirt" ]
        check-after = true
    }
}

```

# Configuration templates

Templates are a great way to compose configuration profiles.

Please keep in mind that `yaml` files are sensitive to the number of spaces. Also if you declare a block already declared, it overrides the previous declaration (instead of merging them).

For that matter, configuration template is probably more useful if you use the `toml` or `hcl` configuration format.

Here's a simple example

```
{{ define "hello" }}
hello = "world"
{{ end }}
```

To use the content of this template anywhere in your configuration, simply call it:

```
{{ template "hello" . }}
```

Note the **dot** after the name: it's used to pass the variables to the template. Without it, all your variables (like `.Profile.Name`) would display `<no value>`.

Here's a working example:

```toml
#
# This is an example of TOML configuration using nested templates
#

# nested template declarations
# this template declaration won't appear here in the configuration file
# it will only appear when called by {{ template "backup_root" . }}
{{ define "backup_root" }}
    exclude = [ "{{ .Profile.Name }}-backup.log" ]
    exclude-file = [
        "{{ .ConfigDir }}/root-excludes",
        "{{ .ConfigDir }}/excludes"
    ]
    exclude-caches = true
    tag = [ "root" ]
    source = [ "/" ]
{{ end }}

[global]
priority = "low"
ionice = true
ionice-class = 2
ionice-level = 6

[base]
status-file = "{{ .Env.HOME }}/status.json"

    [base.snapshots]
    host = true

    [base.retention]
    host = true
    after-backup = true
    keep-within = "30d"

#########################################################

[nas]
inherit = "base"
repository = "rest:http://{{ .Env.BACKUP_REST_USER }}:{{ .Env.BACKUP_REST_PASSWORD }}@nas:8000/root"
password-file = "nas-key"

# root

[nas-root]
inherit = "nas"

    [nas-root.backup]
    # get the content of "backup_root" defined at the top
    {{ template "backup_root" . }}
    schedule = "01:47"
    schedule-permission = "system"
    schedule-log = "{{ .Profile.Name }}-backup.log"

    [azure-root.backup]

    schedule = "03:58"

# mysql

[azure-mysql]
inherit = "azure"

    [azure-mysql.backup]
    tag = [ "mysql" ]
    run-before = [
        "rm -f /tmp/mysqldumpall.sql",
        "mysqldump -u{{ .Env.MYSQL_BACKUP_USER }} -p{{ .Env.MYSQL_BACKUP_PASSWORD }} --all-databases > /tmp/mysqldumpall.sql"
    ]
    source = "/tmp/mysqldumpall.sql"
    run-after = [
        "rm -f /tmp/mysqldumpall.sql"
    ]
    schedule = "03:18"

```

# Debugging your template and variable expansion

If for some reason you don't understand why resticprofile is not loading your configuration file, you can display the generated configuration after executing the template (and replacing the variables and everything) using the `--trace` flag.

# Limitations of using templates

There's something to be aware of when dealing with templates: at the time the template is compiled, it has no knowledge of what the end configuration should look like: it has no knowledge of profiles for example. Here is a **non-working** example of what I mean:

```toml
{{ define "retention" }}
    [{{ .Profile.Name }}.retention]
    after-backup = true
    before-backup = false
    compact = false
    keep-within = "30d"
    prune = true
{{ end }}

[src]
password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key"
repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}"
lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock"
initialize = true

    [src.backup]
    source = "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src"
    check-before = true
    exclude = ["/**/.git"]
    exclude-caches = true
    tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"]

    {{ template "retention" . }}

    [src.snapshots]
    tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"]

[other]
password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key"
repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}"
lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock"
initialize = true

    {{ template "retention" . }}

```

Here we define a template `retention` that we use twice.
When you ask for a configuration of a profile, either `src` or `other` the template will change all occurrences of `{ .Profile.Name }` to the name of the profile, no matter where it is inside the file.

```
% resticprofile -c examples/parse-error.toml -n src show
2020/11/06 21:39:48 cannot load configuration file: cannot parse toml configuration: While parsing config: (35, 6): duplicated tables
exit status 1
```

Run the command again, this time asking a display of the compiled version of the configuration:

```
% go run . -c examples/parse-error.toml -n src --trace show
2020/11/06 21:48:20 resticprofile 0.10.0-dev compiled with go1.15.3

  6: lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-default.lock"
  7: initialize = true

 13:     exclude-caches = true
 14:     tag = ["default", "dev"]

 16:
 17:     [default.retention]
 18:     after-backup = true
 19:     before-backup = false
 20:     compact = false
 21:     keep-within = "30d"
 22:     prune = true
 23:
 24:
 25:     [src.snapshots]
 26:     tag = ["default", "dev"]
 27:
 28: [other]
 29: password-file = "/Users/CP/go/src/resticprofile/examples/default-key"
 30: repository = "/backup/Friday"
 31: lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-default.lock"
 32: initialize = true
 33:
 34:
 35:     [default.retention]
 36:     after-backup = true
 37:     before-backup = false
 38:     compact = false
 39:     keep-within = "30d"
 40:     prune = true
 41:
 42:
====================
2020/11/06 21:48:20 cannot load configuration file: cannot parse toml configuration: While parsing config: (35, 6): duplicated tables
exit status 1
 ```

 As you can see in lines 17 and 35, there are 2 sections of the same name. They could be both called `[src.retention]`, but actually the reason why they're both called `[default.retention]` is that resticprofile is doing a first pass to load the `[global]` section using a profile name of `default`.

 The fix for this configuration is very simple though, just remove the section name from the template:

```toml
{{ define "retention" }}
    after-backup = true
    before-backup = false
    compact = false
    keep-within = "30d"
    prune = true
{{ end }}

[src]
password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key"
repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}"
lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock"
initialize = true

    [src.backup]
    source = "{{ .Env.HOME }}/go/src"
    check-before = true
    exclude = ["/**/.git"]
    exclude-caches = true
    tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"]

    [src.retention]
    {{ template "retention" . }}

    [src.snapshots]
    tag = ["{{ .Profile.Name }}", "dev"]

[other]
password-file = "{{ .ConfigDir }}/{{ .Profile.Name }}-key"
repository = "/backup/{{ .Now.Weekday }}"
lock = "$HOME/resticprofile-profile-{{ .Profile.Name }}.lock"
initialize = true

    [other.retention]
    {{ template "retention" . }}
```

And now you no longer end up with duplicated sections.

# Documentation on template, variable expansion and other configuration scripting

There are a lot more you can do with configuration templates. If you're brave enough, [you can read the full documentation of the Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

For a more end-user kind of documentation, you can also read [hugo documentation on templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/) which is using the same Go implementation, but don't talk much about the developer side of it.
Please note there are some functions only made available by hugo though.

# Using resticprofile and systemd

systemd is a common service manager in use by many Linux distributions.
resticprofile has the ability to create systemd timer and service files.
systemd can be used in place of cron to schedule backups.

User systemd units are created under the user's systemd profile (~/.config/systemd/user).

System units are created in /etc/systemd/system

## systemd calendars

resticprofile uses systemd
[OnCalendar](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.time.html#Calendar%20Events)
format to schedule events.

Testing systemd calendars can be done with the systemd-analyze application.
systemd-analyze will display when the next trigger will happen:

```
$ systemd-analyze calendar 'daily'
  Original form: daily
Normalized form: *-*-* 00:00:00
    Next elapse: Sat 2020-04-18 00:00:00 CDT
       (in UTC): Sat 2020-04-18 05:00:00 UTC
       From now: 10h left
```

## First time schedule

When you schedule a profile with the `schedule` command, under the hood resticprofile will
- create the unit file (of type `notify`)
- create the timer file
- run `systemctl daemon-reload` (only if `schedule-permission` is set to `system`)
- run `systemctl enable`
- run `systemctl start`


# Using resticprofile and launchd on macOS

`launchd` is the service manager on macOS. resticprofile can schedule a profile via a _user agent_ or a _daemon_ in launchd.

## User agent

A user agent is generated when you set `schedule-permission` to `user`.

It consists of a `plist` file in the folder `~/Library/LaunchAgents`:

A user agent **mostly** runs with the privileges of the user. But if you backup some specific files, like your contacts or your calendar for example, you will need to give more permissions to resticprofile **and** restic.

For this to happen, you need to start the agent or daemon from a console window first (resticprofile will ask if you want to do so)

If your profile is a backup profile called `remote`, the command to run manually is:

```
% launchctl start local.resticprofile.remote.backup
```

Once you grant the permission, the background agents/daemon will be able to run normally.

There's some information in this thread: https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/2051

*TODO: I'm going to try to compile a comprehensive how-to guide from all the information from the thread. Stay tuned!*

### Special case of schedule-permission=user with sudo

Please note if you schedule a user agent while running resticprofile with sudo: the user agent will be registered to the root user, and not your initial user context. It means you can only see it (`status`) and remove it (`unschedule`) via sudo.

## Daemon

A launchd daemon is generated when you set `schedule-permission` to `system`. 

It consists of a `plist` file in the folder `/Library/LaunchDaemons`. You have to run resticprofile with sudo to `schedule`, check the  `status` and `unschedule` the profile.
