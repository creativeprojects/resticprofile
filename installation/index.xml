It works on macOS, FreeBSD and Linux:
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/master/install.sh | sh It should copy resticprofile in a bin directory under your current directory.
If you need more control, you can save the shell script and run it manually:
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile/master/install.sh chmod +x install.sh sudo ./install.sh -b /usr/local/bin It will install resticprofile in /usr/local/bin/
Debian package WakeMeOps publishes packages for restic and resticprofile.</description></item><item><title>mac OS</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/macosx/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/macosx/index.html</guid><description>Installation with Homebrew Thereâ€™s a homebrew tap for resticprofile:

Installation using scoop Resticprofile can be installed from scoop main bucket:
scoop install resticprofile Installation using winget Resticprofile can be installed using winget which is included with Windows 10 and 11.
winget install creativeprojects.resticprofile Manual installation Download the package corresponding to your system and CPU from the release page Once downloaded you need to open the archive and copy the binary file resticprofile (or resticprofile.exe) in your PATH.</description></item><item><title>Ansible</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/ansible/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/ansible/index.html</guid><description>Installation using Ansible Installation using Ansible is not streamlined, but hereâ€™s the playbook Iâ€™m using on my servers:
Playbooks resticprofile.yml This is very much work in progress. Once I get a stable ansible script I should publish it to Ansible Galaxy.
The playbook is installing (or upgrading):
latest restic binary to /usr/local/bin latest resticprofile binary to /usr/local/bin the resticprofile configuration file from a template file found in ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/profiles.* to /root/resticprofile/profiles.* password files that can be encrypted using ansible vault. These files are located in ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/keys/*: they will be decrypted and saved to /root/resticprofile/. other files (like files needed for --exclude-file, --files-from or anything else you need) from ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/copy/* to /root/resticprofile/ Note This new version (21st Feb 2023) installs the github3 python packages in a virtual environment. This seems to avoid having to compile the cryptography package, which is a huge time saver.</description></item><item><title>Source</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/source/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/source/index.html</guid><description>Installation from source You can download the source code and compile it, itâ€™s actually very easy! all you need to have on your machine is:
git (with git-bash on Windows) go compiler GNU Make which is installed by default on many unix boxes. On debian based distributions (Ubuntu included) the package is called build-essential. To compile from sources:
git clone https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile.git cd resticprofile make build Your compiled binary (resticprofile or resticprofile.exe) is available in the current folder.</description></item><item><title>Upgrade</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/upgrade/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/upgrade/index.html</guid><description>Once installed, you can easily upgrade resticprofile to the latest release using this command:
resticprofile self-update Package Managers The self-update command is not available when installed via a package manager (homebrew, scoop). You should use the upgrade built in the package manager instead.
resticprofile will check for a new version from GitHub releases and asks you if you want to update to the new version. If you add the flag -q or --quiet to the command line, it will update automatically without asking.</description></item><item><title>Docker</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/docker/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/docker/index.html</guid><description>Using resticprofile from a docker image You can run resticprofile in a Docker container, which is the easiest way to install and update resticprofile and restic simultaneously.
However, you must mount your backup source (and local destination, if applicable) as a Docker volume. On macOS, backups may be slower due to the known performance issues with mounted volumes.
Registries The officiel image is available on docker hub
docker pull creativeprojects/resticprofile:latest as well as on Github Container Registry</description></item><item><title>Shell Completion</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/shell/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/shell/index.html</guid><description>Shell command line completions are provided for bash and zsh.
To load the command completions in shell, use:
# bash eval "$(resticprofile generate --bash-completion)" # zsh eval "$(resticprofile generate --zsh-completion)" To install them permanently:
resticprofile generate --bash-completion > /etc/bash_completion.d/resticprofile chmod +x /etc/bash_completion.d/resticprofile</description></item></channel></rss>
