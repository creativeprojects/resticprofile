Playbooks resticprofile.yml This is very much work in progress. Once I get a stable ansible script I should publish it to Ansible Galaxy.
The playbook is installing (or upgrading):
latest restic binary to /usr/local/bin latest resticprofile binary to /usr/local/bin the resticprofile configuration file from a template file found in ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/profiles.* to /root/resticprofile/profiles.* password files that can be encrypted using ansible vault. These files are located in ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/keys/*: they will be decrypted and saved to /root/resticprofile/. other files (like files needed for --exclude-file, --files-from or anything else you need) from ./resticprofile/{{ inventory_hostname }}/copy/* to /root/resticprofile/ Note This new version (21st Feb 2023) installs the github3 python packages in a virtual environment. This seems to avoid having to compile the cryptography package, which is a huge time saver.</description></item><item><title>Source</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/source/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 23:50:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/source/index.html</guid><description>Installation from source You can download the source code and compile it, it’s actually very easy! all you need to have on your machine is:
git (with git-bash on Windows) go compiler GNU Make which is installed by default on many unix boxes. On debian based distributions (Ubuntu included) the package is called build-essential. To compile from sources:
git clone https://github.com/creativeprojects/resticprofile.git cd resticprofile make buildYour compiled binary (resticprofile or resticprofile.exe) is available in the current folder.</description></item><item><title>Upgrade</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/upgrade/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 23:57:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/upgrade/index.html</guid><description>Once installed, you can easily upgrade resticprofile to the latest release using this command:
resticprofile self-update Package Managers The self-update command is not available when installed via a package manager (homebrew, scoop). You should use the upgrade built in the package manager instead.
resticprofile will check for a new version from GitHub releases and asks you if you want to update to the new version. If you add the flag -q or --quiet to the command line, it will update automatically without asking.</description></item><item><title>Docker</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/docker/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 23:58:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/docker/index.html</guid><description>Using resticprofile from a docker image You can run resticprofile inside a docker container. It is probably the easiest way to install resticprofile (and restic at the same time) and keep it updated.
But be aware that you will need to mount your backup source (and destination if it’s local) as a docker volume. Depending on your operating system, the backup might be slower. Volumes mounted on a mac OS host are well known for being quite slow.</description></item><item><title>Shell Completion</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/shell/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 23:55:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/installation/shell/index.html</guid><description>Shell command line completions are provided for bash and zsh.
To load the command completions in shell, use:
# bash eval "$(resticprofile generate --bash-completion)" # zsh eval "$(resticprofile generate --zsh-completion)"To install them permanently:
resticprofile generate --bash-completion > /etc/bash_completion.d/resticprofile chmod +x /etc/bash_completion.d/resticprofile</description></item></channel></rss>
