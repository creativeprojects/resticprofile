You can configure a copy section like this:
toml yaml hcl [default] initialize = false repository = &amp;#34;/backup/original&amp;#34; password-file = &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; [default.copy] initialize = true repository = &amp;#34;/backup/copy&amp;#34; password-file = &amp;#34;other_key&amp;#34; default: initialize: false repository: &amp;#34;/backup/original&amp;#34; password-file: key copy: initialize: true repository: &amp;#34;/backup/copy&amp;#34; password-file: other_key default { initialize = false repository = &amp;#34;/backup/original&amp;#34; password-file = &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; copy = { initialize = true repository = &amp;#34;/backup/copy&amp;#34; password-file = &amp;#34;other_key&amp;#34; } } You will note that the secondary repository doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to have a 2 behind its flags (repository2, password-file2, etc.</description></item><item><title>HTTP Hooks</title><link>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/http_hooks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 19:46:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/configuration/http_hooks/</guid><description>Send HTTP messages before and after a job As well as being able to run shell commands, you can now send HTTP messages before, after (success or failure) running a restic command.

It is probably the easiest way to install resticprofile (and restic at the same time) and keep it updated.
But be aware that you will need to mount your backup source (and destination if it&amp;rsquo;s local) as a docker volume. Depending on your operating system, the backup might be slower. Volumes mounted on a mac OS host are well known for being quite slow.</description></item></channel></rss>
