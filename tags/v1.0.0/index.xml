You can try to use it since v0.17.0 but it&amp;rsquo;s for testing and feedback only.
Introduction The current file format was decided at the time resticprofile was only using the toml format. Nesting pieces of configuration in blocks is not the easiest as you have to specify the whole path in the block:
[profile] [profile.backup] source = &amp;#34;some path&amp;#34; Since then, I believe the yaml format is preferred over toml.</description></item></channel></rss>
